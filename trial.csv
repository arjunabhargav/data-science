Misapplying the Newsvendor Problem ,"Thu, 09 Jan 2020 19:28:52 +0000"," The Stitch Fix blog recently had a good intro to the newsvendor problem. For more details and extensions of the basic problem, I’d recommend this paper by Qing et. al.  I think the newsvendor problem is a very valuable mental model, but I have seen newsvendor-ish thinking misapplied very frequently, particularly in healthcare management. In this post, I’m going to try to explain two common misapplications of the newsvendor framework. Newsvendor problem setup  But first, let’s recap the setup of the newsvendor problem. Agents: There is one newsvendor, and several customers who show up during the course of the day, each of whom buys one newspaper.Goals: The newsvendor wants to stock newspapers so as to match the daily demand. For example, if 100 people show up, then the newsvendor would like to have a stock of 100 newspapers, no more, no less.  Randomness: However, demand is stochastic and varies from day to day. We’ll assume here that daily demand is drawn from a normal distribution. Stockouts: If a customer arrives and finds that there are no newspapers left in stock, then that customer leaves without getting anything. This is important, we’ll come back to it later.Required solution: How many newspapers should the newsvendor stock?  



Solution using overage and underage costs To solve this problem, the newsvendor first makes two calculations, to the find the “cost of overage” and the “cost of underage”. Here’s what those terms mean: Cost of overage (too many newspapers): this is the cost to the newsvendor of each paper that is left unsold. This might be the price that the newsvendor paid to the publisher/printer. Let’s denote this CO. Cost of underage (too few newspapers): this is the cost in terms of lost sales for each unit of demand that is unmet. We’ll denote this COU From these two numbers we’ll calculate a ratio called the critical ratio. The critical ratio is CU/(CU+CO). Note that CU and CO are specific to the particular circumstances that prevail for this particular newsvendor.The next and final step is to plug the critical ratio into the inverse CDF of the demand distribution. This gives us the optimum number of newspapers that the newsvendor should stock. There we go, problem solved.



As an example, let’s say that overage and underage costs are the same. Then the critical ratio is 0.5. Plug this into the inverse CDF of the demand distribution and we’ll get back the mean demand/50th percentile (assuming normality). 



 Misapplications of the newsvendor framework Here are a couple of common misapplications that I see: Defaulting to “magic numbers” such as the 95th percentile Using the newsvendor formulation in cases where the assumptions don’t apply, and therefore focusing on the wrong output. Let’s look at each in turn.  Misapplication 1: Defaulting to the 95th percentile It might be a bit inaccurate to call this a misapplication of the newsvendor problem, as it’s more of a failure to apply the framework at all. However, I think it comes from a vague sort of newsvendor-ish thinking. Let’s imagine a conversation between the Chief Marketing Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of a retail company. The CMO says, “We want to serve as much demand as possible. We may not be able to hold enough stock to meet the maximum possible demand, but we should go for the 95th percentile of demand.”This reasoning comes from a good place – the CMO is not just trying to meet average demand, but instead recognizing that there is variability around the average. However, they are only looking at the problem from one side – avoiding underage costs. The CFO is likely to respond, “Do we really need to stock that much? By definition, the 95th percentile almost never happens. I don’t want to tie up so much working capital in inventory if we don’t need it.” This is the other side of the problem – avoiding overage costs. Within the newsvendor framework, the solution is based on the critical ratio that takes into account the underage and overage costs. And there’s no reason why this ratio would always be 0.95, or 0.75, or any other specific number. It depends on the specifics of the situation.  Misapplication 2: Failing to recognize a queueing problem This is a more serious misapplication. I’ll explain using a specific example: imagine you’re working in a hospital, and you’re trying to find the right capacity for the emergency department (ED) to meet demand. Here’s how this maps back to the newsvendor setup: The number of beds in the ED is analogous to the stock of newspapers that the newsvendor has. Just like in the newsvendor problem, you have to decide on the number of beds (the “stock”) before the stochastic demand materializes, and you can’t change capacity during the day to meet daily demand. So, can you use the newsvendor framework here? I would say no, not in any simple way. Remember point 4 in the newsvendor setup, the one about what happens if there’s a stockout? Well, it doesn’t apply here. If a patient arrives to the ED and there are no free beds, they aren’t turned away. Instead, they end up waiting until a bed gets freed up. This fundamental property of the system makes it a queueing problem, not a newsvendor problem.  How does this change our recommended solution? It is almost always true that wait times matter as a key output in queuing problems. As a patient going to the ED I wouldn’t care at all that the number of beds is equal to the Xth percentile of the demand distribution. What I would care about is: “Can I access a bed in a reasonably short amount of time?”The newsvendor formulation just doesn’t have any way of accounting for wait times. It also fails to highlight one of the most important properties of queueing systems: performance (in terms of wait times) decreases rapidly and nonlinearly as the average utilization rate approaches 100%. Furthermore, it’s important to realize that the rate of performance decline depends on the size of the system and the level of variability. These are all features that are important to account for. Therefore, for this kind of problem, I would strongly recommend some kind of queueing model, rather than the newsvendor-ish thinking of “just match the 95th percentile of demand”, or even a more informed application using the critical ratio.          ]]>",https://www.datascienceish.net/blog/2020/1/9/misapplying-the-newsvendor-problem
I see your AUC and I'm not impressed ... yet,"Thu, 26 Dec 2019 06:45:41 +0000","Eric Topol’s paper on AI/ML in healthcare made a big splash when it came out earlier this year. It’s a broad review of published models that have the potential to impact three different stakeholder groups: clinicians, patients, and the healthcare delivery system.One of the key takeaways of the paper is that although researchers report pretty good AUC scores for models that predict health outcomes (Table 3 of the paper), this doesn’t really mean that the models would have any clinical benefits if deployed. In other words, who cares that you can predict well, if you’re not improving patient well-being? This point also came up in an interview with Marzyeh Ghassemi, a researcher at the University of Toronto.Topol stresses that prospective trials are necessary to show actual clinical benefit. This means it’s not enough to just get high AUC scores on historical data; instead, someone has to actually deploy the model and then track patient outcomes to see whether they improve significantly after the deployment. To date there have been very few of these prospective trials – Topol calls this the “AI chasm”.What if we look beyond healthcare – has anyone been doing this kind of prospective trial to evaluate their ML/AI models? Yes, it’s standard practice at Booking.com, as this paper shows.The authors say:In Booking.com we are very much concerned with the value a model brings to our customers and our business. Such value is estimated through Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and specific business metrics like conversion, customer service tickets, or cancellations.They go on to say that in their work there are diminishing returns to model performance (better AUC =/= more $$$), and hypothesize about what might explain this. Except for the uncanny valley effect, I think all of the explanations could apply to ML/AI in healthcare as well. ]]>",https://www.datascienceish.net/blog/2019/12/26/i-see-your-auc-and-im-not-impressed-yet
Complex systems don't necessarily need more black boxes,"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 07:32:07 +0000","In the book Prediction Machines, the authors break down the anatomy of a decision task, noting that the following components must come together for an AI system to make accurate predictions: input data, model training, and feedback data. Furthermore, for the AI system to be useful, there must be clear, agreed-upon actions that follow from a prediction, based on judgments about risk. 













  

    
  
    

      

      
        


Figure 7-1 from Prediction Machines


Perception tasks are a clear example where all these ingredients come together, and this is why we now have AI systems that can usefully diagnose certain eye diseases, for example. In contrast, in predicting ""social outcomes"" or the outcomes of poorly-understood processes, such as recidivism, hospital readmissions, and sepsis, the appropriate actions to take can be very unclear, and any two experts could make different conclusions about the costs and benefits of a given action. Generating useful predictions in this kind of context is still very much an open problem. The best we have are ""good habits"" and rules of thumb. Perhaps one rule of thumb we should add to the list is: ""the most accurate models [in a complex social context] aren't necessarily the most un-interpretable/complicated ones … the standard should be changed from the assumption that interpretable models do not exist, to the assumption that they do, until proven otherwise"". This is the argument made in an article in the latest issue of the Harvard Data Science Review. As part of the Explainable AI Challenge at NeurIPS 2018, the authors built an interpretable model for credit scoring, and found that the difference in accuracy between that model and a black box model was negligible. As they say, ""The false dichotomy between the accurate black box and the not-so accurate transparent model has gone too far."" ]]>",https://www.datascienceish.net/blog/2019/12/18/complex-systems-dont-necessarily-need-more-black-boxes

Python to the Rescue,"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000","<p>I’m evaluating whether or not I should move this blog to another CMS platform so I can start building a community around it like it was before.</p>
<p>Right now this blog runs on Hugo and AWS Amplify and it’s <strong>freaking awesome</strong>. I push new posts to GitHub, AWS pulls the changes and rebuilds the site, and then I can look at make sure it looks fine before I merge into master.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Migrating between CMS platforms is always a tricky and pain-in-the-ass endeavor.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cloudfront caches my images so load times are wicked fast (an SEO must) and Hugo is a dream to work with. In my humble opinion, it’s the best static CMS out there. Pelican might come in second, but Hugo just rocks and you can use it in a headless way too.</p>
<p>However, it’s static and there’s little I can do to integrate nicely to have things like member profiles or build a BuddyPress type of social networking site.</p>
<p>That said, I could do something like that with a separate technology like phpBB in the future. I could just create a subdomain like social.neuralmarkettreds.com and install a social networking platform there.</p>
<p>No matter what I choose to do (and Hugo is by far outweighing everything I’m looking at), I’ve been writing a lot of python scripts to format my posts in a way that will let me upload them to a dev instance of whatever CMS I choose.</p>
<p>Migrating between CMS platforms is always a tricky and pain-in-the-ass endeavor.</p>
<p>Going from WordPress to WordPress is easy. Going from WordPress to Hugo is easy. Going from WordPress to Ghost is easy but migrating from Hugo or Ghost to WordPress is a bit harder.</p>
<p>Migrating to ExpressionEngine is just nuts but the DataGrab plugin helps a lot (when it works).</p>
<p>The nice thing about Hugo is that I can expose my posts as JSON or RSS (XML format). I can limit the number of posts in my feeds to prevent scrapers from extracting everything from my site.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>That’s it, 5 lines of code that I needed to format my exposed posts into a CSV file.</em></p>

Restarting the Site,"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000","<p>I shut Neural Market Trends down on the last day of August thinking it was going to be for good. Things have changed on my end and I’m thinking of restarting this site. I’m thinking of moving back to my roots and building a community.</p>
<p>Why? Because of something I saw a few days ago.</p>
<p>I was on a work call the other day and a prospect was sharing his screen. I noticed he had a bookmark to the popular HackerNoon site.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with being a fan of HackerNoon, I’m one of them as well, but the fact they were using <em>that site</em> to get insight into the very complex world of Machine Learning, Data Science, and AI was fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>This very blog</strong> started with the express purpose of helping people learn RapidMiner, a Data Science platform. Yes, it was to learn how to trade the stock market with AI, but my tutorials have helped 1000’s people.</p>
<p>That was always my express goal with this site, to help people and I think I deviated away from that mission over the past few years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest takeaway was from this test was that nobody cared.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I started writing about different topics that were <em>not</em> related to Data Science, Machine Learning, or AI. Things like SEO and passive investing. I learned a helluva lot from those two topics but my long-time readers came here to learn from tutorials and have their finger on the “AI pulse” of things.</p>
<p>I stopped writing on those topics because I ended up working in the field. I still love what I do every single day but I got tired from <strong>writing about it.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“we’re not planting a tree, we’re raising a forest.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seems to be the curse, once you do something you love and earn money from it you really start to burn out from it.</p>
<p>Then, about a month ago I made a test here. I ported the blog over to the Ghost CMS. I successfully achieved the port after many long hours BUT I had severe issues in getting everything running correctly.</p>
<p>While partially successful I reverted back to a Hugo-based blog hosted on AWS.</p>
<p>The biggest takeaway was from this test was that nobody cared. My community has for the most part left, the people I helped are now being helped by others.</p>
<p>First off, I’m glad they’re being helped by others. They’re being helped by the TowardsDataScience and HackerNoon publications. I’ve seen how wildly successful those writers have become and they did it by <em>sharing their knowledge</em>.</p>
<p>That realization coupled with the call I had hit me like a ton of bricks and it re-inspired me.</p>
<h2 id=""the-way-forward"">The way forward</h2>
<p>What now? That’s a most interesting question that I’m thinking about it a lot.</p>
<p>I think first and foremost I want to get back to my roots, back to Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI.</p>
<p>Second, I think I want to build a new community and continue to share knowledge, not just mine but those who decided to come on this journey (later).</p>
<p>In order to do that I will need to make some structural changes to the backbone of how I’m running things. Hugo won’t cut it anymore, things will need to become dynamic.</p>
<p>I thought back to what Sri Ambati CEO of H2O said (paraphrased), “we’re not planting a tree, we’re raising a forest.” Those words keep echoing in my head ever since I heard them for the first time in 2018.</p>
<p>This means I plan to start posting again. I’m going to plant seedlings and raise a forest. I have a lot more tutorials and other knowledge to share from working in this field now for over 7 years.</p>
<p>In other words, stay tuned, a new forest is being planted.</p>

Kubernetes & Julia Language,"Sun, 01 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000","<p>I&rsquo;m coming up on my 3rd anniversary at H2O.ai and we&rsquo;ve embarked on an interesting pivot of sorts. Our new product is based on <a href=""https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/"">Kubernetes</a>. At first I thought Kubernetes is just another buzz word and a way for the Cloud providers to extract more money from users, but I&rsquo;ve come to realize that it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Of course, there are pros and cons with Kuberentes, it&rsquo;s new and isn&rsquo;t widely adopted by organizations as of yet, but it&rsquo;s neat from a container isolation and scalablity standpoint. You build you container, attach an instance, and your off to the races. You might ask, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t Docker do that too?&rdquo; That answer is sort of, both are open source but Kubernetes scales across clusters. Docker runs on a single node.</p>
<p>Since H2O-3 is java based and scalable across a cluster, it make sense for me to dive into it. Distributed architectures are pretty darn cool if you ask me.</p>
<p>What about Julia Language? Why am I even thinking of learning that language when I have a decent grasp on Python?</p>
<p>Readers over here know that I&rsquo;ve been keeping my eye on Julia for a long time but it suffers from low adoptability when compared with Python. Python is everywhere for machine learning and data science, but it&rsquo;s horredously slow.</p>
<p>Sure there are ways to speed it up with Dask and CPython (Python is derived from C) but it requires you to build all that. Julia Language is built from the ground up for statistical and machine learning work. It&rsquo;s precompiled and a lot faster that Python right out of the gate. It comes with GPU and CPU batteries included, nothing for you do except load the library in.</p>
<p>But, as I wrote, it&rsquo;s not widely adopted and who knows if a new version of Python will come out that will solve all the performance issues.</p>
<p>That said, I can see how containerizing a Julia Language instance with a Python based rest service for inferencing can be scaled using Kubernetes. I can also see how conainerizing a Julia Language based machine learning process using GPUs can be easily scaled too.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m going to make it my goal to learn the both over next few months, when I have some free time in between meetings. I think learning Kubernetes is an important skill for me to have, I think that&rsquo;s the wave of the future for cloud computing. Julia Language is something I&rsquo;m hoping for to make it big in the future, but you never know.</p>

Automation and Universal Basic Income,"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000","<p>There was a big news sensation about <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/07/13/burger-king-workers-quit/"">Burger King workers quitting en masse in Lincoln, Nebraska</a>.</p>
<p>All 11 Burger King employees quit because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We became essential,” Johnson said. “And then we weren’t treated essential by upper management.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From what was reported, they had to endure 8-hour shifts without breaks in very hot conditions. One employee was even hospitalized for dehydration, and then was called a &lsquo;baby&rsquo; by management. WTF.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that we hear the standard empty motivational tripe that you’re <em>so essential</em>, and you’re <em>so valuable</em> to us.</p>
<p>Please, spare me your empty platitudes.</p>
<p>Large corporations like Burger King and others only see you as interchangeable labor units. That’s what we called you in MBA school. Your pay, whether hourly or salary, is purely based on a compensation band for a labor unit that you fit into. It doesn’t matter how well you perform.</p>
<h2 id=""the-case-for-automation"">The Case for Automation</h2>
<p>Let’s be realistic, the entire Burger King fast-food process can be automated and run by machines. Would it cost a lot of money to put those machines in? Yes, but they can run 24/7 with no need for breaks, pay, or vacations.</p>
<p>I would dare to say that it would be best to automated everything we can and have humans touch as little as possible in processes. Why is that? Humans make mistakes, automation is only wrong if a human programmed it wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;Those greedy teachers! &hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, there would be a need for redundancy because machines do break down and need service but why don’t they automate all fast-food restaurants? Why don’t they just replace humans? Because each labor unit is cheaper right now and they don’t want to incur the cost.</p>
<h2 id=""the-great-resignation"">The Great Resignation</h2>
<p>The Covid19 Pandemic taught us one thing, we have more power than we realized. Sure it was hard to work from home and front-line workers were stretched too far and too thin, but for the first time that I can remember the corporations were at <em>our mercy.</em></p>
<p>For example, after being treated like sacrificial lambs, droves of teachers just said “screw it, I’m retiring” leaving petty parents to cry, “why won’t they teach little unmasked Johnny? Those greedy teachers! Covid19 isn’t real! Wah!”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;we all paid for their recklessness - and I will never forget it&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead, these teachers now provide tutoring and make a lot more money now and teach on their terms.</p>
<p>Mass resignations are happening all over the country and smart companies are taking notice. They’re enticing qualified workers to join their ranks with better pay, benefits, and flexible working arrangements.</p>
<p>This is a huge win for workers everywhere. In fact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most found other jobs in hospitality between the time they gave notice and their last day of work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what about the people that were automated out of a job? What about them?</p>
<h2 id=""universal-basic-income"">Universal Basic Income</h2>
<p>The reason why there’s such a backlash against universal basic income in this country is that it puts the power into the hands of the worker, and we can’t allow that! /sarcasm</p>
<p>I love the idea of universal basic income (UBI) because it provides a safety net to everyone in this country. It’s an investment in our economy and people for years to come.</p>
<p>Got divorced and relied on your ex to pay the bills? UBI can help you get yourself back on your feet.</p>
<p>Burger King automated its burger-making process and you were laid off? UBI can help you pay your rent while you look for another job or go back to school.</p>
<p>Have a shitty healthcare plan at work and got sick and can’t work for money? UBI can help put food on your table.</p>
<p>Yes, this is socialism and it’s good socialism. I can hear you screaming across cyberspace but hear me out.</p>
<p>The massive bailouts to the banks in 2008 were a form of socialism, we all paid for their recklessness - and I will never forget it<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" class=""footnote-ref"" role=""doc-noteref"">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>That mortgage you owe? It’s probably owned by Fannie Mae, the government. Medicare is socialism. Building bridges and roads is socialism. It’s everywhere and you’re too blind to see.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Live a life, how novel!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What’s wrong with levying a tax on corporations that automated workers out of a job? That tax can easily pay for UBI.</p>
<p>UBI is a radical idea, you get money from the government just for existing but it makes a ton of sense. It stabilizes the economy in volatile times and invests in the general population.</p>
<p>BUT the corporations don’t want that. As Geroge Carlin once said (paraphrased), <strong>they want you smart enough to work the machine but dumb enough not to question it.</strong></p>
<h2 id=""end-notes"">End Notes</h2>
<p>Years ago when I was working in New Mexico my office mate - we shared offices - told me about his plan to only work 3 months out of the year. Once he got his Professional Engineering license, he would only take 3 jobs a year. These jobs would be of sufficient size to command roughly $20,000 of income each, so that would be $60,000 a year - a handsome income for the 1990s.</p>
<p>Why did he only want to work 3 months out of the year? Because he wanted to play volleyball, spend time with his family, go on trips, and <strong>live a life</strong>.</p>
<p>Live a life, how novel!</p>
<p>We hear so much about work-life balance that it’s become just another passing platitude like <em>essential workers</em>, it gets paid a lot of lip service but how dare you actually live it.</p>
<p>The joke at Booz Allen Hamilton when I worked there was that they believed in a “work-life balance”, as long as you remember that work came first in that equation.</p>
<p>Tear it all down folks, burn it down. Automate, Resign, Live your Life.</p>

Work From Home is Here to Stay,"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Work from home (WFH) is here to stay if you’re lucky and fight for it. I keep hearing from my customers that more and more companies are starting to reopen and call back employees to the office, except many are not coming back!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s music to my ears!</p>
<p>After dealing with the sudden pandemic shutdowns, juggling work-home duties, and dealing with the isolation, the majority of American workers powered through this hell. <strong>We did it.</strong> We kept our companies afloat and not just survived, but thrived. I don&rsquo;t know about your work environment, but we accelerated our productivity over the last year.</p>
<p>As companies open up, they&rsquo;re making demands for workers to come back to the office. They&rsquo;re asking employees to prove to them why they should keep the privilege of work from home.</p>
<p>Say what?</p>
<p><em>We kept your asses afloat during the pandemic and you want US to prove to you that we should be able to continue WFH?</em></p>
<p><strong>SLAM!</strong> That was the door closing on the employee exodus. Workers are not tolerating this bullshit and it&rsquo;s leading to a massive talent shuffle.</p>
<h2 id=""boomers-love-control"">Boomers Love Control</h2>
<p>I recently shared a <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-01/return-to-office-employees-are-quitting-instead-of-giving-up-work-from-home?utm_content=billionaires&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-billionaires&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic"">Bloomberg article</a> on my <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6805810607401639936/"">LinkedIn wall</a> and added some commentary.</p>
<p>I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seven years ago I left the Civil Engineering industry where Work From Home (WFH) was frowned on. The people in charge of the companies assumed that you&rsquo;d be goofing off if you did WFH. Then the Covid19 pandemic hit and those Engineering companies HAD TO ADAPT and allow WFH, after all, there was always a deadline to meet.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This Bloomberg article really nails the feeling of many professionals that are forced to come into work when a WFH scenario is in everyone&rsquo;s best interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;there’s also the notion that some bosses, particularly those of a generation less familiar to remote work, are eager to regain tight control of their minions.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“They feel like we’re not working if they can’t see us,” she said. “It’s a boomer power-play.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This article is a shot across the bow to all industries. WFH is here to stay and if you want to attract and keep key talent you&rsquo;re going to have to evolve AND fast. #careers #engineering #workfromhome</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Technology has allowed a massive swath of workers to WFH, except those in charge refused to let us do it. Because they were afraid we&rsquo;d be sleeping on the couch.</p>
<p>Do you know what we did with WFH instead? We saved at least 2 hours of commuting every day. We were able to pick up our kids at school without rushing out the door of the office. We got to spend more time with our families or friends. We had a <em><strong>life</strong></em> in that fucked up work-life balance platitude we keep hearing.</p>
<p>And we were more productive than we ever.</p>
<h2 id=""fight-for-work-from-home"">Fight for Work From Home</h2>
<p>The Boomer tyrants are going to work hard to get you to come back to the office, fight for your right to have a flexible arrangement.</p>
<p>I get it, some people like the office interaction and seeing their colleagues - I do too - but do you need to go to the office 5 days a week? Why not do a 2 day in the office / 3 day WFH, or so another arrangement that makes sense for you.</p>
<p>Whatever is the optimal arrangement is for you, the main premise is this: a flexible work schedule makes a lot of sense from cultivating happy workers AND productivity.</p>
<p>Hell, you might not need so much office space anymore and cut back on leasing costs. This might lead to less development of commercial real estate, which is OK in my book.</p>

Passive Income Update,"Thu, 01 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000","<p>I&rsquo;ve stopped posting about my various investments that I use to generate passive income because no one cares. Sure they want to find out some ideas but there&rsquo;s plenty of ideas to glean from StockTwits or Reddit forums. Right now everyone is focused on the meme stocks like <a href=""https://stocktwits.com/symbol/BB"">$BB</a> or <a href=""https://stocktwits.com/symbol/GME"">$GME</a>, but those are flashes in the pan. Just the normal noise in the market every day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing pretty damn great for 2021.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I, on the other hand, have been steadily adding to my dividend income-producing stocks to help me generate monthly and quarterly income. The goal, as I&rsquo;ve posted before is to generate enough monthly income once I reach 59 1⁄ 2 so I can retire early and just live off the dividends till I can withdraw from my 401k and live happily ever after.
The good news? I&rsquo;m getting closer to critical mass, or what&rsquo;s often called Coast FIRE.</p>
<h2 id=""coast-fire"">Coast FIRE</h2>
<p>Coast FIRE is not a forest fire along a coast. The FIRE part is short for Financial Independence / Retire Early. The Coast part means that you&rsquo;ve amassed enough seed money that left along will generate enough money for you to live when you retire into perpetuity. You&rsquo;ve essentially set yourself up for the future. Here&rsquo;s a handy <a href=""https://walletburst.com/tools/coast-fire-calc/"">Coast Fire calculator</a> I use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Master the money and your life will follow…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concept is really easy to understand and you can get there faster if you start early. I know, not everyone HAS the luxury of investing money, but you can start small if you&rsquo;re young. This is one of the big reasons why I&rsquo;ve opened up custodial IRA accounts for my kids. They&rsquo;re busy earning money at summer jobs and they can put that cash into an IRA and invest in ETFs. My daughter is long $XLV and my son is busy evaluating the market. Not bad for a 16 and 14-year-old.</p>
<p>If the world doesn&rsquo;t die in a fiery death (aka climate change) and there&rsquo;s no social unrest, my kids are setting themselves up for a Coast FIRE a lot earlier than me. I think that&rsquo;s a good thing because who wants to keep trading their life for money? Master the money and your life will follow, don&rsquo;t be a slave to money.</p>
<h2 id=""how-am-idoing"">How am I doing?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing pretty damn great for 2021. I&rsquo;m having the best year so far for dividends, surpassing my record as early as May of this year. I&rsquo;m averaging $400 per month in dividend income that I just reinvest. Most of the biggest gains I get are from RYLD and QYLD, which are higher risks but I have 9 years to ride out any market fluctuations.
Am I on target? Not quite. For someone in my income range and the quality of life, I expect to continue to live on, that $400 per month has to be closer to $5,000 per month. On top of that my wife wants to retire at the same too so that number is probably closer to $10,000 per month or $120,000 per year. We should get a boast in this after I reach 62 and start collecting social security.</p>
<p>Still, $120,000 per year is really high considering our house would be paid off and the kids out of college and (hopefully) on their own. We haven&rsquo;t made up our mind yet but moving out of New Jersey is definitely something we&rsquo;re considering, preferably to a state with low taxes or no state income tax.</p>
<p>What would be a great interim goal is to generate enough monthly dividend income where I could match my future social security income? I don&rsquo;t know the exact number that that would be somewhere between $2,000 and $3,000. Building up my dividend income to $2,000 a month seems very achievable for the short-term.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m &ldquo;stream of consciousness&rdquo; writing this because nothing is clear yet. In the meantime I spend my time just pouring money in my 401k and adding to our dividend stocks when I can. And that&rsquo;s the best thing I feel I can do right now and wait for the picture to get clearer over the next few years.</p>

No matter how many ‘stonks go up’ and ’stick it to the Hedge Fund guys’ retail traders there are, you can’t escape the fundamentals.

One Year of SEO Optimization,"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000","<p>In April 2020 my blog was barely alive. I had moved to Hugo from Pelican and ignored any kind of SEO optimization for it. I thought it was stupid and that the best content would win. Little did I know that my content wasn&rsquo;t even being found! So after thinking about it for a few short minutes, I decided to dive back into SEO and figure out how to bring my blog back from the dead.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a Google Analytics chart of my Organic Searches for topics my blog posted about.</p>

  alt=""Neural Market Trends Organic Searches"">
<p>I had <strong>39 organic search sessions</strong> in April 2020! The content that drove me to the top of the Google Searches in 2010-2014 dropped into obscurity. Granted, not posting and keeping the blog fresh was ONE of the problems I had but because I moved CMS&rsquo;s a lot, I lost a lot of backlink juice and general SEO optimization (i.e. JSON-LD, keywords, etc).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m estimate I&rsquo;ll close near 1,000 organic search sessions by the time April is over, which is a 25 fold increase over a year. That&rsquo;s amazing but also what I consider low-hanging fruit SEO optimization.</p>
<p>So how did I do it? I just minded a few things and my site turned around. The following items I&rsquo;m going to share have no particular order, they&rsquo;re all important!</p>
<h2 id=""mind-the-load-speed"">Mind the Load Speed</h2>
<p>One of the biggest problems I had was page loading speed. Some pages loaded between 6 and 10 seconds, which is a lifetime in today&rsquo;s mobile-focused world. My images weren&rsquo;t <a href=""https://neuralmarkettrends.com/hugo-seo-tutorials/"">optimizated for screen size</a> or in modern web format (.webp). My template was bloated with Javascript and all kinds of add-ons like Disqus that just ate into loading my pages.</p>
<p>Why is page loading time important? Google will penalize your site if it&rsquo;s too slow to load by dropping you in the rankings, so I decided to rebuild for speed.</p>
<p>I dropped Disqus for and <a href=""https://neuralmarkettrends.com/joining-indie-web/"">IndieWeb implementation</a>. I did this for two reasons: one to speed up the site and two to claw back my content from siloed organizations like Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>Then I found a stripped-down theme and made implemented a Hugo Shortcode that optimized my images for screen size AND lazy loading. If you went to web.dev or gtmetrix and plugged in my domain (neuralmarkettrends.com) you&rsquo;d see I&rsquo;d get an &lsquo;A&rsquo; or &gt;90 ratings for performance. My load time now is less than 3 seconds.</p>
<p>Can I optimize this further, yes but it&rsquo;s one of those Pareto 80/20 rule things. I think I&rsquo;m good now.</p>
<h2 id=""mind-the-yaml"">Mind the YAML</h2>
<p>When writing content for a static-based blog like Hugo, Jekyll, or Pelican, you want to optimize the head of the content page. I write using Frontmatter YAML and make sure to populate it with Keywords, Tags, Author, Image Callouts for Social Media, Slug/URL, and a Description.</p>
<p>All these elements are used to optimize your content in Google&rsquo;s eyes. Although keywords are deprecated in Google&rsquo;s algorithm now (thanks to keyword stuffing), it comes in handy for JSON-LD.</p>
<p>These Frontmatter YAML elements can be parsed into your static webpage when you &lsquo;build&rsquo; your site and you have a lot of flexibility in applying this if you tweak your themes. I found a better JSON-LD template that generates rich and detailed data in the head of every post I generate. Google slurps that right up.</p>
<h2 id=""mind-the-slugsurls"">Mind the Slugs/URLS</h2>
<p>Permalinking and building the right URL structure for posts or content is an art form in itself. There are lots of SEO companies that say you have to remove stopwords (I agree) and have a keyword or two in the URL (I agree here too!). I opted for a stripped-down version of my blog URLs by doing something like: <code>neuralmarkettrends.com\post-keyword-something</code></p>
<p>Since I use Hugo and they support URL Aliases, experimenting and correcting old URLs was never easier. If I had an old URL like <code>/rapidminer-how-tos/</code> I would add the alias frontmatter yaml and call out the corrected URL of <code>/rapidminer-tutorials/</code></p>
<p>Why did I change <strong>rapidminer-how-tos</strong> to <strong>rapidminer-tutorials</strong>? Simple, because tutorials are a more powerful keyword when you search on Google and it makes more sense.</p>
<p>If someone finds an old backlink to <code>/rapidminer-how-tos/</code> and they click on it, it will resolve to the new <code>/rapidminer-tutorials/</code> without giving me a 404 error</p>
<h2 id=""mind-the-json-ld"">Mind the JSON-LD</h2>
<p>JSON-LD is simpling a JSON formated data object meant for linking data together. I found JSON-LD to be very helpful in generating nice search results in Google and index my content better. It was a simple add to my templates and every time I make a change or write new posts, everything gets updated on the site.</p>
<p>The beauty of this is that you can tweak and add any bit of Frontmatter YAML from your posts to the JSON-LD too!</p>
<h2 id=""mind-the-content"">Mind the Content</h2>
<p>Content is king and you should savor it. You should always post to your domain first so you can keep control of and get the most SEO juice from Google. Of course, you should write some great content too, and update your blog often.</p>
<p>If you have a lot of content that&rsquo;s low value and is very short in length, you should consider removing it or updating it. Google loves updating old posts and I did just that. I combined several tutorials on the same subject into one mega-post with a table of contents. This has helped me rank higher in certain categories. For example, my RapidMiner tutorials are very old, but combining the tutorials got me back on the second page of the Google results.</p>
<h2 id=""mind-the-404s"">Mind the 404&rsquo;s</h2>
<p>404&rsquo;s or dead links are a big strike in Google so you should spend your time hunting for the dead links and backlinks that will confuse your readers and damage your SEO. Provide a good search option as well in case readers can&rsquo;t find what they&rsquo;re looking for easily and fast.</p>
<p>Once you identified the 404 errors, look to see if you can redirect readers from that URL to new the post URL. If you use HUGO, you can write an Alias for the URL and solve that problem fast!</p>
<h2 id=""where-do-we-go-from-here"">Where do we go from here?</h2>
<p>Up. We go up from here. To the Moon!</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s my goal for the next year. Quite honestly, I was hoping to be at 10,000 organic searches but I&rsquo;m happy with 1,000 for now. Why? Because it&rsquo;s phenomenal growth considering that last year, at this time, my blog was barely clinging to life support.</p>
<p>Thank&rsquo;s for reading!</p>

Passive Income - T Dividends,"Sat, 20 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000","<p>There are many reasons why I hold AT&amp;T (<a href=""https://stocktwits.com/symbol/T"">$T</a>) for my passive income goals. The first one is that it was around during the Great Depression and the second, it will probably be around during the next Great Depression. I can be pretty sure that AT&amp;T will weather the storm if another future event like the Great Depression strikes the markets.</p>
<p>Sure, all the stocks will drop in price, including the ones with dividends, but think of those skyrocketing dividend yields! That&rsquo;s how you got to look at it.</p>
<h2 id=""stock-price"">Stock Price</h2>
<p>T closed at $30.01 yesterday (3/18/2021). It&rsquo;s a stock that&rsquo;s not in favor right now and that&rsquo;s ok in my book. If I were to look at my <a href=""https://neuralmarkettrends.com/python-tutorials/#autogenerating-support-and-resistance-lines"">secret sauce chart generator</a>, it looks like it&rsquo;s approaching an old resistance line with price support down around the $28.70 level.</p>

<p>Running Mr. Markov yields me an interesting picture of independent price outcomes. The price histogram chart is definitely skewed and the average price is $49.95 for AT&amp;T.

I&rsquo;m not going to make any predictions but &lsquo;reversion to the mean&rsquo; strategies point to the price to come up a bit. Maybe.</p>

The only thing that attracted me to the stock was its high dividend yield of 6.94% and many people will say I fell into a dividend trap. Great point but I look at the estimated earnings projections for next quarter and see a way higher from here.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T is a good dividend producer, it&rsquo;ll net you $2.08 a year in dividends and the stock is trading with a N/A for PE ratio. It&rsquo;s forward PE points to 9+, so earnings are expected to grow. Normally I&rsquo;d give this stock a pass BUT, it&rsquo;s AT&amp;T after all. It&rsquo;s not going anywhere.</p>

<h2 id=""passive-income-risks"">Passive Income Risks</h2>
<p>The biggest risk I see here is AT&amp;T missing its earnings and not going positive next quarter, but I think in the long run they&rsquo;ll make money again.</p>
<p>They rode out the Great Depression and still paid out dividends during that time. AT&amp;T is not going anywhere and it sits on a huge pile of cash. Let&rsquo;s face it, telecommunications will continue to be around after I&rsquo;m long dead and buried, so picking up some shares for my passive income strategy makes a ton of sense.</p>

"Subscriptions, Adsense, 20Booksto50K. Oh My!","Fri, 19 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000","<p>I’m done with my Medium vs Adsense experiment here. This is all part of a passive income strategy evaluation game I’m playing. I’m trying to see if I can build a $100,000 a year passive income portfolio. I know it will take time but I like playing these kind of games.</p>
<p>Right now I’m evaluating a mix of different things such as dividend-producing stocks, web monetization, and Adsense. So far for February, Adsense is beating the pants off my Medium income.</p>
<p>Why? That’s an interesting question and without access to the data Google has on my site, I can’t be conclusive but I can guess. My guess? It’s my search engine optimization (SEO).</p>
<h2 id=""optimizing-seo--adsense"">Optimizing SEO &amp; Adsense</h2>
<p>I spent a ton of time last year optimizing my old blog for SEO so I can rank higher on Google search results. I switched from Pelican to Hugo — both static CMS generators — and ported it all to <a href=""https://neuralmarkettrends.com/wordpress-hugo-aws-amplify/"">AWS Amplify</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;a hosting platform like Medium can toss you and all your hard work off of it on a whim.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s given me blazing speed load times and because of that, I was able to put Adsense on and not affect page load times. Yes, I took a small hit but the load times vastly outperform my old WordPress and Pelican site.</p>
<p>Optimizing my SEO with fast load times has given me a big bump on the Google SERP rankings, almost all of my tutorials are now ranking on the first or second page. The only negative thing about that is that my tutorials are niche topics so the audience will always be small for them. Still, it’s nice to see the fruits of my labor paying off.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the beginning of 2021, I started writing more about passive income topics there as a way to diversify my content and attract a diverse readership.</p>
<p>When I added Adsense back in (my guess here), Google saw a site that started in 2007 with newly SEO optimized posts and load times and went wild. It started to serve relevant ads and kept learning what makes people click on the ads.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use Medium to generate traffic to my site by crossposting articles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Granted Adsense was slow on the uptake for the first half of the month but I’m generating daily clicks and impression income. Right now it’s paying for my AWS Amplify hosting and that’s a BIG win in my book.</p>
<h2 id=""medium-publishing--the-porn-apocalypse"">Medium Publishing &amp; The Porn Apocalypse</h2>
<p>What about Medium? I like Medium a lot and you can get a lot of notoriety there if you’re a good and entertaining writer. There are several writers that I follow that seem to make a living writing on Medium and kudos to them!</p>
<p>However, Medium feels like a single point of failure if you exclusively write and derive your main income from there. Why? Because you are at the whim of some publication you post to and your topics might not be all that interesting.</p>
<p>If you’ve seen what’s happening with the porn apocalypse (aka pornocalypse), a hosting platform like Medium can toss you and all your hard work off of it on a whim. For those that don’t know about this <a href=""http://www.erosblog.com/2013/05/01/the-pornocalypse-comes-for-us-all/"">pornocalypse</a> ( NSFW link), it’s where sites like Tumblr — who have hosted adult content for years — suddenly decide that it’s no longer a safe corporate thing to do and kick off adult content from their service.</p>
<p>Whether or not you do adult content, it’s always best to have your own hosted domain on the Internet. This way you can sell a product, service, or subscription without fear of being shut down. Of course, if you do something illegal then all bets are off, so don’t do anything illegal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or in the immortal words of Arnold Schwarzenegger, “kill me now!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you do have your own site then you have to think about attracting views to your articles or pages. You have to work on SEO (most modern CMS’s do that well) and build a ‘go to’ market strategy.</p>
<p>I use Medium to generate traffic to my site by crossposting articles. You can post your articles on social media and even buy Ads from Google to drive more traffic to your site. I know buying Ads from Google just feels ‘yucky’ but coupled with a good strategy it can do wonders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It reminds me a lot of my effort vs time curve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember, all of us are just some person or company screaming in the void of the Internet something like “I’m over here! I got something to say!” Or in the immortal words of Arnold Schwarzenegger, “kill me now!”</p>

<h2 id=""dont-monetize-your-hobby"">Don’t Monetize Your Hobby</h2>
<p>There’s a reason why I bring up the ‘go to’ market strategy,it’s because of these two Reddit posts I recently read. They both got me thinking long a hard about what the hell I’m doing with my blogs.</p>
<p>The first Reddit post is about a writer who is giving up on self-publishing.</p>
<p>I can sympathize with him, when you self-publish you perform every single task that a traditional publisher would do for you. You would just focus on writing a great novel and they would market it, distribute it, book your ‘meet and greets,’ etc. Doing all this in addition to writing can be overwhelming.</p>
<p>The other post supports the idea that you shouldn’t monetize your hobby, to which I partly agree.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea is with the right cover, right story, and right price point you should generate $50,000 a year from your work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m sure we heard that saying that if you find what you love and earn a living at it, you’ll never have to work a day in your life.</p>
<p>How romantic!</p>
<p>How full of shit that is.</p>
<p>If you’ve got a fun side hustle or hobby it might be a bad idea to trying to turn it into a full-time job. There’s nothing wrong with having fun, making a few bucks (or not) from it, and doing it for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>For me, it’s baking sourdough bread. While I find it romantic to have a small bakery making sourdough bread, it’s NOT something I want to make a living at.</p>
<h2 id=""20booksto50k-strategy"">20BooksTo50K Strategy</h2>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with doing a lot of things for fun and if you can learn from it. For example, I recently found this <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/20Booksto50k/"">20BooksTo50K Facebook group</a>. That group is filled with writers that are writing a minimum of 20 books to be published on Kindle or Kindle Unlimited.</p>
<p>The idea is with the right cover, right story, and right price point you should generate $50,000 a year from your work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because blogging was new and no one wanted to pay for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That group is filled with advice on how to do all the stuff the original Reddit poster complained about. Yes, you have to bust your butt but the sales from their books sure sound like passive income to me.</p>
<p>It reminds me a lot of my effort vs time curve.</p>

  alt=""Time vs Effort Curve"">
<p>You have to write a novel or novella, then design and make a cover, then market it. Once the writing, cover design, and distribution is out of the way, you can focus on small amounts of marketing to keep your novel in the mind space of people.</p>
<p>This is part of the reason I restarted my ThomasOtt.IO blog again. One reason was to see if I could migrate to the <a href=""https://neuralmarkettrends.com/install-ghost-aws-lightsail/"">Ghost CMS</a> and the other is I needed a new place for my writings. It’s another watering hole for me to lament about things, analyze data, and play the passive income game.</p>
<p>Ghost has some really nice features. For example, I can create a members-only and a paid-members-only section. I experimented with that setup years ago on Neural Market Trends but it failed, but it still remains in my mind space. Maybe this time I could get it to work.</p>
<p>Why did it fail? Because blogging was new back then and no one wanted to pay for it. Now, people will pay for things if the price point is right AND you have something of value to share.</p>
<p>There are ways to make a living by blogging and building content. Medium has shown us the way with subscriptions and I like that method a lot. The trick is to build up a big enough following to get them to come and pay a monthly subscription at the right price point.</p>
<p>Medium charges $50 per year, which comes out to $4.17 per month. I could make a subscription site for $3.99 a month but my problem would be what to share with you all?</p>
<p>Or, I could try the 20BooksTo50K route and write my stories, which I enjoy a lot. I certainly don’t mind doing the book cover designs, the marketing, the analytics (that’s right up my alley), and the SEO. That’s almost second nature to me now.</p>
<p>For example, I didn’t know that the Mystery and Fantasy books are more popular than Young Adult and Erotic books. I’m not sure which genre would be harder to break into from a self-publishing aspect but this data shows some interesting trends.</p>

<h2 id=""automating-a-wave-server-and-app"">Automating a Wave Server and APP</h2>
<p>There are two things that happen when you run a Wave Server and Wave App, you have to make sure the Wave Server is running and that the Wave App is inside a virtual environment that&rsquo;s active.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of moving parts but it can be automated with a nice script that you can install upon your instances boot up.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple bash script that I wrote to run the Wave Server in the background and make sure my stock app is running inside the virtual environment and is reachable.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

cd wave-0.13.0-linux-amd64
nohup ./waved &amp;

cd /home/ubuntu/apps/stock
source venv/bin/activate
nohup wave run --no-reload src.app &amp;
</code></pre><p>Make sure to <code>chmod +x mystartupscript.sh</code> and save it.</p>
<p>Note the <code>--no-reload</code> part. When Wave is in dev mode it scans the directories of where your apps are for any code changes. In production, you want to disable that because it can use up CPU power!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it!</p>

Installing Ghost CMS on AWS Lightsail,"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000","<p>This tutorial is not about porting Hugo posts to the Ghost format but instead it’s about how I got a custom domain, CDN, and removed the :80 port from a new Ghost install.</p>
<p>First off, setting up the machine on AWS Lightsail is pretty easy. It was as simple as selecting the Ghost install and taking the cheapest instance possible. I think the cost is like $3.50 a month, which is pretty sweet IMHO.</p>
<p>The harder part was then the configuration of everything. When the instance spins up you get a dynamic IP assigned to it. It’s not a pretty custom domain name but rater something like <code>123.45.67.890</code>, not easy to remember and it does change when you reboot the instance.</p>
<p>I had to set up a static IP (an added yearly cost) to avoid the IP from changing because I was rebooting this instance a lot.</p>
<p>Once I got the static IP, then I had to attached my custom domain <code>thomasott.io</code> to it. I thought that while I was doing that I should make sure that it’s SSL enabled and that my content would be served through a CDN (Content Delivery Network) for scalability and robustness.</p>
<p>Just those tasks forced me through down a rabbit hole that’s taken me about a day (on and off timewise) to configure my instance. It was fun because I got to tinker with domains, CDNs, and other backend related stuff, something I normally <em>don’t</em> do.</p>
<p>This tutorial is about how to turn your site into a real Ghost site once you go your AWS Lightsail instance running.</p>
<h2 id=""the-instance"">The Instance</h2>

<h2 id=""logging-in-to-ghost"">Logging in to Ghost</h2>
<p>This was an annoying part, I didn’t know where to log into the Ghost admin panel at first. The answer is:</p>
<p><code>http://YOUR-DYNAMIC-IP/ghost</code></p>
<p>But what are the credentials?  The Ghost instance is managed by Bitnami and they have specific instructions on how to log into your Ghost instance. You have to SSH into the instance and run a command to get the password. The default username is <code>bitanmi</code>.</p>
<p>Once you SSH into your instance, get the password, then go to:</p>
<p><code>http://YOUR-DYNAMIC-IP/ghost</code></p>
<p>Then log in and make a new user. That user will be you and don’t forget your login credentials.</p>
<h2 id=""remove-bitnami-header"">Remove Bitnami header</h2>
<p>Once I had a user and tested logging in successfully, I then looked to get rid of that annoying Bitnami header. This was easy to do, I just used the bnhelper tool.</p>

<h2 id=""set-up-custom-domain-zone"">Set up Custom Domain Zone</h2>
<p>Now this part got tricky, setting up the Custom Domain Zone. Here I wanted to attached my AWS registered domain <code>thomasott.io</code> to the this static IP.</p>
<p>In order to do that I needed to make sure that the DNS servers that this instance requires are the same DNS servers set up in my Route 53 Hosted Zone.</p>
<p>There are some important things you need to set up in Route 53 to make sure everything resolves correctly. The problem is that you’ll be setting them up a bit out of order.</p>
<p>The key things for Route 53 is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the Domain Name Servers are the same in Route 53 and your Lightsail instance of Ghost</li>
<li>You point an A Name record to the Cloudfront Distribution URL (we haven’t set this up yet)</li>
<li>That your SSL certificate is verified so you can get <code>https</code> (we haven’t set this up yet either)</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem is that you won’t have all the information to finish this configuration until you set up your CDN and SSL certificates.</p>
<h2 id=""set-up-the-cdn"">Set up the CDN</h2>
<p>It’s advisable to serve your images and content through a CDN (Content Delivery Network). Why? Because it helps with load times and uptime. Ever since I switched to a CDN my SEO for my other blog has skyrocketed. You should consider this too.</p>

<p>Once you create your SSL certificate, it will ask you to verify it. You will need to take that information and create a CNAME record in Route 53. Once you do that, you should be done with all your Custom Domain Name/Zone configurations.</p>
<p>The remaining steps are related to the backend of Ghost and configuration the web and production server.</p>
<h2 id=""update-machine-name"">Update Machine Name</h2>
<p>SSH into your instance and update your machine name. To do that you’ll need to do the following commands referenced <a href=""https://docs.bitnami.com/aws/apps/ghost/administration/configure-domain/"">here</a>.</p>
<p><code>sudo /opt/bitnami/apps/ghost/bnconfig --machine_hostname example.com</code></p>
<p>where you replace <code>example.com</code> with your custom domain.</p>
<p>Then to make sure it ‘sticks’ when reboot you’ll have to rename the <code>bnconfg</code> file like so:</p>
<p><code>sudo mv /opt/bitnami/apps/ghost/bnconfig /opt/bitnami/apps/ghost/bnconfig.disabled</code></p>
<h2 id=""update-httpd-vhostconf"">Update httpd-vhost.conf</h2>
<p>This next step caused me grief because I couldn’t find the damn httpd-vhost.conf file at first.</p>
<p>I finally found it at <code>/opt/bitnami/apps/ghost/conf/</code></p>
<p>You have to edit this file and update it with your custom domain information. I followed ‘Approach B’ in <a href=""https://docs.bitnami.com/aws/apps/ghost/administration/redirect-custom-domains/"">these instructions</a>.</p>
<p>Then I restarted the web server.</p>
<h2 id=""update-production-settings"">Update Production settings</h2>
<p>Once I got this point everything started to work well except I had the port <code>:80</code> appended to my custom domain <code>thomasott.io</code>. it drove me nuts.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I read this <a href=""https://community.bitnami.com/t/ghost-changing-to-https-and-stop-it-from-appending-80-to-everything/43589"">post on how to remove it</a> that I realized there’s this production setting for Ghost.</p>
<p>One I removed the <code>:80</code> from the JSON file and restarted the instance, everything work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;and by passive I don’t mean lazy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a great question! You know that there’s no right or wrong answer here.</p>
<p>What’s my advice? <a href=""https://amzn.to/38bBdTJ"">Read this book</a> (affiliate link) and then go do your favorite hobby.</p>
<p>The markets are an artificial construct, built by humans, run by humans, and misunderstood by humans. It’s rigged and will always be so. As I’ve pondered before, how do you ‘unrig’ the market and stack the odds in your favor?</p>
<p>Simple, <a href=""https://amzn.to/38bBdTJ"">read this book</a> (affiliate link) and then go do your favorite hobby.</p>
<p>Seriously, go read that book. It changed everything for me and I’ve taken a more passive approach to investing, and by passive I don’t mean lazy.</p>
<p>I still keep my eye on the ball and I’m still listening to Mr. Market, I just do things differently so I can stack the odds more in my favor.</p>
<h2 id=""dollar-cost-averaging"">Dollar Cost Averaging</h2>
<p>Want to stack the odds in your favor? The simplest thing to do is to dollar cost average across diverse asset groups. I recently read that the <a href=""https://www.macroresilience.com/2010/07/08/heuristics-and-robustness-in-asset-allocation/"">1/N method</a> of asset allocation outperforms all complex ones with low turnover and minimizing trading fees.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“there is no single model that consistently delivers a Sharpe ratio or a CEQ return that is higher than that of the 1/ N portfolio, which also has a very low turnover.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 1/N model is simple, count up how many assets you have (N) and then divide. If you have 10 stocks, then each stock shouldn’t make up more than 1/10 of your entire portfolio.</p>
<p>Diversify! Diversify! Diversify! And keep fees low.</p>
<p>So what about today and the Roaring 20&rsquo;s? I believe that there’s so much cash from the Trump (and soon Biden) stimulus that the market is going to extend higher from here. I think a pullback is overdue, but Wall Street will start partying like it’s 1999 again.</p>
<p>What about a 1929 crash? Will that happen? I think most definitely, I just don’t know when. Main Street will see the stock market go higher and they’ll start to feel better, the economy will strengthen once Covid19 is under control and everyone, I mean everyone, will start to party.</p>

<p>The good times will roll until the bill is due and this time, it’s going to be a big one.</p>
<p>Is it a possibility, yes. Probability? Yes, but I don’t know what that is right now. That’s my guess.</p>

<h2 id=""1929-market-crash-protection"">1929 Market Crash Protection</h2>
<p>I was searching for how to be defensive if, and if, a big 1929 stock market crash were to happen today. What stocks weathered the storm and why.</p>
<p>I still haven’t figured it all out but I keep seeing that dividend-producing stocks weathered the 1929 market crash. Sure they took a beating, but if you had cash on the sidelines back then you could’ve snapped up some quality names.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coca-Cola traded at $2.66 for every $1.00 in book value, with a dividend yield of 7.79%.  This represented a 57% drop, excluding dividends, from the 1929 peak.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>AT&amp;T traded at $0.64 for every $1.00 in book value, with a dividend yield of 10.34%.  This represented an 82% drop, excluding dividends, from the 1929 peak.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Colgate-Palmolive traded at $0.44 for every $1.00 in book value, with no dividends distributed.  This represented a 92% drop from the 1929 peak.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gillette (now part of Procter &amp; Gamble) traded at $0.85 for every $1.00 of book value with a dividend yield of 13.77%.  This represented a 95% drop from the 1929 peak. <em>via <a href=""https://www.joshuakennon.com/a-look-at-some-major-stocks-during-the-bottom-of-the-1933-stock-market-crash/"">A Look at Some Major Stocks During the Bottom of the 1933 Stock Market Crash</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guess what? Those stocks are <em>still trading</em> today and they’re producing dividends! What if I was invested in them (I am long T) and watching them fall 80-90% from their peak? I’d probably shit my pants first of all but I’d know that they’d still generate dividends that will help me buy low - very low - and wait for a rebound.</p>
<p>That’s the thing with these rigged markets. People lose their grip on reality as prices go up, willing to buy higher and higher, and then get scared when the market sells off. It’s precisely when the market stabilizes lower that you should “Buy The Fucking Dip (BTFD)”. Of course, everyone will be burned and very shy to do so.</p>
<p>This is why saving and long-term investing works, you BTFD and ride it out with dividends. It just sucks if the market crash happens when you’re getting ready to retire!</p>

Passive Income for February 2021,"Mon, 01 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000","<p>This is my second monthly report on how my passive income journey to $100,000 a year is working. This month my passive income was a lot lower. QYLD didn&rsquo;t have a dividend payout and RYLD&rsquo;s payout is happening tomorrow.</p>
<p>However, my <strong>Adsense experiment</strong> and <strong>Medium</strong> produced the most non-dividend income. The downside was that it wasn&rsquo;t enough to exceed last month&rsquo;s total income. Overall, I expect there to be blips and bumps along this $100,000 journey and that&rsquo;s ok.</p>
<p>I continue to write and wrote up a storm this month by sharing my dividend-growth strategy. I shared <a href=""https://neuralmarkettrends.com/5-tips-dividend-passive-investing-portfolio/"">5 Tips to Building a Dividend Passive Income Portfolio</a> and pondered the <a href=""https://neuralmarkettrends.com/search-low-touch-passive-income-generator/"">Search for a Low Touch Passive Income Generator</a>.</p>
<p>With that said, here&rsquo;s my passive income report for February 2021.</p>
<h2 id=""web-monetization"">Web Monetization</h2>
<p>I made some money on Web Monetization this month, a lot less than last month. I earned <strong>$0.74</strong>. I added web monetization to my recent rebuild of <a href=""https://thomasott.io"">Thomasott.io</a>. I&rsquo;m now using the GhostCMS over there and it&rsquo;s made me realize that paid subscriptions are the better way to go. Coil Web Monetization <a href=""https://thomasott.io/keeping-what-works-and-tossing-what-doesnt-work/"">might be a futile waste of time</a>.</p>
<h2 id=""medium"">Medium</h2>
<p>I posted less on Medium this month but beat my previous month&rsquo;s earnings. I wrote some poetry that only a few people cared about but my posts on the markets and investing seemed to generate the most income for me. This month I made <strong>$8.06</strong>! That&rsquo;s the more than last months but not by a lot.</p>
<p>The biggest money-producing articles were my <a href=""https://medium.com/p/how-to-migrate-away-from-wordpress-to-hugo-and-aws-amplify-62b0360a3b9f"">Wordpress to Hugo</a> and my <a href=""https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/my-search-for-a-low-touch-passive-income-generator-d0e9f0c0f896"">Low Touch Passive Income Generator</a>.</p>
<h2 id=""affiliates"">Affiliates</h2>
<p>Once again, I made <strong>$0.00</strong> dollars on affiliate income. While I&rsquo;ll continue to use Amazon affiliate links for the books I like to read, I&rsquo;m not going to put a lot of effort into this. I think affiliates work once you get a big enough readership and Internet clout.</p>
<h2 id=""google-adsense"">Google Adsense</h2>
<p>I had a very good Adsense month. I made a <strong>$6.96</strong> for the month. I had a flurry of income in the middle of the month but it began to dwindle to the end of the month.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to run Adsense for another month but I&rsquo;m thinking of dropping these annoying ads and converting a portion of this blog a subscription site using GhostCMS. For that to happen, I need to write a script to convert all my posts to the GhostCMS JSON format. I&rsquo;m almost there with a draft script and once it works, I will start the long process migration.</p>
<h2 id=""dividends"">Dividends</h2>
<p>February was a decent dividend month for me. I made <strong>$52.00</strong>, which is less than the month before but that&rsquo;s the nature of payouts. You try to get something for each month but the reality is that some months are not going to be good. I expect March to be spectacular. <a href=""https://stocktwits.com/symbol/JNJ"">$JNJ</a>, <a href=""https://stocktwits.com/symbol/QYLD"">$QYLD</a>, and <a href=""https://stocktwits.com/symbol/RYLD"">$RYLD</a> are expected to make a sizable payout.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> All dividends were reinvested for this month. I plan to do this for the entire 2021 while I BTFD (Buy The Fucking Dip) and add to more holdings over the coming months.</p>

Passive Income - JNJ Dividends,"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Today is the day I want to write about Johnson and Johnson (<a href=""https://stocktwits.com/symbol/JNJ"">$JNJ</a>) and why I&rsquo;m holding it for the long term. One, it&rsquo;s a well-established company that cranks out great products that everyone uses, and two it has amazing dividends. For each share of JNJ, you get $4.04 of dividends per year. JNJ hits all the sweet spots for building my $100,000 a year passive income portfolio. Let&rsquo;s dig a bit deeper as to why.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s my goal, assemble a diverse group of dividend-producing individual stocks and ETF&rsquo;s that each won&rsquo;t make up more than 20% of my entire portfolio.</p>

<p>JNJ closed at $160.44 yesterday, which is right the green support line in my <a href=""https://neuralmarkettrends.com/python-tutorials/#autogenerating-support-and-resistance-lines"">secret sauce chart generator</a>.

<li>Low price target of $65.21</li>
</ul>
<p>I highly doubt that any of the high and low price targets will be hit but Mr. Markov calculated those levels to be within 2 standard deviations of the average.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ok, I&rsquo;ve been long JNJ for years and recently added to my position. It now makes up 28% of my entire dividend passive income portfolio, which is <strong>too high</strong> for me. No, I won&rsquo;t sell it but I&rsquo;ll add to other holdings in my portfolio to bring that percentage down to no more than 20%.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my goal, assemble a diverse group of dividend-producing individual stocks and ETF&rsquo;s that each won&rsquo;t make up more than 20% of my entire portfolio. I do this because I want to spread my risk around.</p>
<h2 id=""dividends--fundamentals"">Dividends &amp; Fundamentals</h2>
<p>JNJ has a relatively low dividend yield compared to my other high flyers, it&rsquo;s currently at 2.48%. Normally I&rsquo;d buy stocks that have a dividend yield over 3% if it&rsquo;s my first time entering a position, but I&rsquo;ve held onto JNJ for years and just added to it instead. JNJ pays a dividend every 3 months and the next one will be in March for $1.01 per share.</p>
<p>If I had 25,000 shares of JNJ - roughly $4,025,000 invested with JNJ - I&rsquo;d be on target to making my $100,000 a year passive income, <strong>but c&rsquo;mon!</strong> <em>Who has a cool $4 million lying around?</em></p>

<p>The best part? It has a beta of 0.72, which means it&rsquo;s not very volatile compared to the rest of the market. It&rsquo;s a steady ship that&rsquo;s sailing to my passive income destination and making me money.</p>

<h2 id=""passive-income-risks"">Passive Income Risks</h2>
<p>There are always risks with this type of investing. When you&rsquo;re starting you only have a little bit of money and it&rsquo;s hard to grow that into something big. I usually recommend focusing on growth stocks when you&rsquo;re starting out. Find some nice trends, ride them, and get off.</p>
<p>When you get off with profits, then invest the profits and principal in a dividend-producing stock. Of course, you should always do this in a retirement account so you can save yourself the capital gains and dividend taxation costs at the end of the year.</p>

<p>The risk for JNJ is a pull back to lower prices. I admit, it has a lofty PE ratio right now and it wouldn&rsquo;t meet my screen criteria right now. I&rsquo;m not overly concerned with a massive price pullback because I&rsquo;m holding JNJ for the long term. If it dips to $100 a share, cool! I&rsquo;ll be buying more shares with my $1.01 dividend at that price and further lowering my cost average.</p>
<p>Of course, the other risk is your time horizon. If you don&rsquo;t have a long time horizon then don&rsquo;t do this type of investing. You won&rsquo;t see any concrete results for at least 10 years! For me, my target is in 9 years from today when I&rsquo;m legally allowed to retire and tap my IRAs.</p>
<p>Have a plan, keep your eye on the ball, and reclaim your time. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m doing it, to reclaim my time!</p>

5 Tips to Building a Dividend Passive Income Portfolio,"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Building a dividend producing passive income portfolio requires thought, time, and education. Today I&rsquo;m sharing <strong>5 tips for building a dividend passive income portfolio</strong> and how you can figure out the right strategy for you.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve written before, this idea came to me after my wife and I reviewed her 401k at the end of 2020. She had by accident generated a large sum of dividends without even trying. This was the same for me in my 401k as well and we generated $800 in dividends by accident in our trading account.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As 2020 was ending I took some time to look at our 401k balances. This was a good year for our investments, all things considered, but one thing surprised me. There was a line item for &ldquo;dividend&rsquo;s earned&rdquo; and it was quite a large number.  My wife&rsquo;s 401k earned more dividends than what I made as a salary in my first year out of college! <strong>via <a href=""https://neuralmarkettrends.com/passive-investing-dividends/"">Passive Investing with Dividends</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder what would happen if I focused on building this income? Could I retire early and spend the rest of my life doing fun things? I think the answer is yes, but I needed to do some research and figure out a strategy forward.</p>
<h2 id=""tip-1---research"">Tip 1 - Research</h2>
<p>Before you do anything, and I mean anything, you need to start from the very beginning. That beginning is educating yourself about this particular strategy. My first tip is to join the Reddit group <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/"">r/Divdends</a>. It&rsquo;s a very good group with lots of great information for anyone to get started.  I go there for the discussion on different stocks, how to set up a portfolio, how to track it, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;you will need time for this to grow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides, the book <a href=""https://amzn.to/3ddCmgP"">&ldquo;Get Rich With Dividends&rdquo;</a> (affiliate link) is a must-read resource.  This book clued me into how to screen for Dividends in my brokerage account and what to look for in the fundamentals of a stock.</p>

<h2 id=""tip-2---start-in-a-retirement-account"">Tip 2 - Start in a Retirement Account</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a tax professional but what I do know is that generating dividends is a <strong>taxable event</strong>. If you hold a dividend producing stock in a taxable account like a brokerage account, you will pay taxes on that income. The best thing to do to build up your passive income is to do it first in a qualified retirement account like a 401k or IRA. I chose an IRA because it allows me to hold individual stocks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make smart buys now and just reinvest the dividends&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I reinvest all my dividends at no fee in my IRA because I don&rsquo;t need the income right this moment but in 9 years. This leads me to Tip #3, you will need time for this to grow.</p>
<h2 id=""tip-3---you-will-need-time"">Tip 3 - You Will Need Time</h2>
<p>I spoke with a friend recently who&rsquo;s taking care of his father. His father is very old but was smart in his younger years to amass a sizable stock portfolio. He kept reinvesting his dividends for over 5 decades!  When my friend looked at the amount of money that was being reinvested and what the costs were to provide long term care to his father, he stopped reinvesting the dividends. He just took the dividend payout as income to help his father now. What good would reinvesting the dividends be at this stage in his father&rsquo;s life?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;fees and keeping your transaction costs low is the key to getting the most out of your passive income stream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His father didn&rsquo;t touch the stocks and dividends for 50+ years and was able to amass what sounds like a massive passive income stream.  Sure it took 50+ years but that was what worked for him, not you. However, you will need time, which is why I&rsquo;m working on a 9-year time horizon.</p>
<p>Make smart buys now and just reinvest the dividends so that when you reach the end of your time horizon, you will have hit your target.</p>

<h2 id=""tip-4---pay-attention-to-fundamentals"">Tip 4 - Pay Attention to Fundamentals</h2>
<p>If you read <a href=""https://amzn.to/3ddCmgP"">&ldquo;Get Rich With Dividends&rdquo;</a> (affiliate link) you will quickly learn that the author has a specific method for analyzing a stock&rsquo;s fundamentals. I think this is a solid approach and you should apply this logic but change it based on your risk profile.</p>
<p>For example, he suggests sticking with stocks that have dividend yields between 3 and 5%. I keep to that suggestion mostly but I do own some stocks that generate higher yields than that. Why? Because I can stomach the risk better.</p>
<p>The key fundamentals he looks out for things like the Dividend Yield, Beta, Earnings Growth, and Payout Ratio. I like to also look at the PE Ratio so I can gauge how &lsquo;frothy&rsquo; at stock is.</p>
<h2 id=""tip-5---diversify"">Tip 5 - Diversify</h2>
<p>Ever since I read <a href=""https://amzn.to/2Nqx72o"">&ldquo;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&rdquo;</a> (affiliate link) I&rsquo;ve been obsessed with diversification. This is why I add dividend producing ETF&rsquo;s to my holdings. Yes, there&rsquo;s a fee associated with holding an ETF and there&rsquo;s a lot of discussion in <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/"">r/Dividends</a> and in the <a href=""https://amzn.to/3ddCmgP"">&ldquo;Get Rich With Dividends&rdquo;</a> (affiliate link) book about making your <em>own</em> portfolio to save money on the fees.</p>
<p>My thoughts on the matter are that I&rsquo;m pushing my risk profile right now and the ETF can help spread that risk around. However, they&rsquo;re 100% right, fees and keeping your transaction costs low is the key to getting the most out of your passive income stream. I will consider this when I start withdrawing mandatory distributions from my 401k and IRA.</p>

<h2 id=""end-notes"">End Notes</h2>
<p>These 5 tips are the things that need to be in your &lsquo;mind space&rsquo; to get you started in dividend investing. Of course, the one thing I didn&rsquo;t write about is that the stocks that you buy won&rsquo;t go up all the time. They&rsquo;ll drop in price, maybe even crash in some cases. I can&rsquo;t tell you what to buy or when to sell, but you will have to figure in this risk as well.</p>
<p>For example, I currently own <a href=""https://stocktwits.com/symbol/GILT"">$GILT</a> because of the high dividend yield. It&rsquo;s a small company that may or may not be around tomorrow. It&rsquo;s risky for sure and I&rsquo;m being a dividend slut. However, a company like <a href=""https://stocktwits.com/symbol/JNJ"">$JNJ</a> isn&rsquo;t going away where. It will be around for years to come and the price was to drop by 50% or more, it will likely continue to pay dividends that you can reinvest <em>if</em> you have a long enough time horizon. This way your average cost per share drops over time and your long-term risk drops.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to think about when adopting this type of strategy and it won&rsquo;t work well for growth investors, but this works for me.</p>

My Search for a Low Touch Passive Income Generator,"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000","<blockquote>
<p>It was a musical thing, and you were supposed to sing, or to dance while the music was played. - Alan Watts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I struggled with where to publish this article. Part of me wanted to post this to my regular blog Neural Market Trends because it&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m writing about this particular subject a lot. The other part of me thought it would be best to share it on Medium with a larger audience. Guess which part won?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been studying the market for passive income and side hustles for a long time. The simple reality is that making money is never easy and if anyone tells you differently, they&rsquo;re a snake oil salesman. In order for passive income to work one of two things (or both) need to be true:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have a large nest egg of money that&rsquo;s generating passive income for you, or;</li>
<li>You have a low touch product or services like an ebook or blog.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, anything that requires you actively work to earn income over the long run isn&rsquo;t passive, it&rsquo;s active. These are things like your current full-time and/or part-time gigs. You have to show up to make money.
While I admit that in creating passive income you will have to work hard (i.e. writing that ebook, setting up the blog and SEO optimizing it, etc), in the long run, your activity on it should decrease.</p>

  alt=""Effort vs Passive Income"">
<p>Some readers might comment that Real Estate Investing (REI) is one of those passive income strategies, to which I resoundingly say &ldquo;NO!&rdquo; There&rsquo;s always something breaking, annoying tenants, and empty apartments to keep you very busy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Gen X&rsquo;er that&rsquo;s annoyed with the Boomers, inspired by the Millennials, and confused by the Gen Z&rsquo;ers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What about starting a business? Can that be a passive endeavor? Can it be active in the beginning and then passive and &lsquo;low-touch&rsquo; later?</p>
<p>The answer to that question is, probably not BUT (there&rsquo;s a big BUT in there) it is possible. You just have to figure out the market and see how others are doing it.</p>
<h2 id=""understanding-the-gen-z-generation"">Understanding the Gen Z generation</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Gen X&rsquo;er that&rsquo;s annoyed with the Boomers, inspired by the Millennials, and confused by the Gen Z&rsquo;ers. Both my kids are young Gen Z&rsquo;ers and my niece is about in the middle of that generation.</p>
<p>I had a long chat with my niece the other day to understand what her age group likes, what they use, and what they find important.</p>
<p>The overwhelming responses were focused on finding passion and purpose, learning, and experiences. We spoke about Instagram, Etsy, YouTube, and the fact that careers are not what they&rsquo;re excited about. The value experiences and connectedness in far deeper ways than I expected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the connectedness of technology is what enables them to have richer and more meaningful lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She reminded me of something that Alan Watts spoke about many years ago (and someone made a nice video about it). Life is a dance, there is no destination and we should enjoy the experience of moving through time and space together.</p>

</div>

<p>For this generation, the connectedness of technology is what enables them to have richer and more meaningful lives. They shop on Instagram, make memes on Reddit, and use dating apps. They love watching YouTube to learn about new skills.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about how to build a low touch product or service. The question is, would it be able to capture a wide swath of generations?</p>
<h2 id=""a-look-at-how-instagram-fetlife-and-reddit-makemoney"">A look at how Instagram, FetLife, and Reddit make money</h2>
<p>After my conversation with her, I thought about how websites make money. I figured that if your site focused on topics like sex, religion, politics, or money you&rsquo;d get a large part of the market of eyeballs.</p>
<p>After my chat with my niece, I&rsquo;m going to add another topic to that list: experiences and learning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After all, sex sells!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought about this over the past few days and started to dig through the various web properties out there. I looked at Instagram mainly because it feels like an &lsquo;experience&rsquo; type of site. Users post their photos of vacations, their brands, and whatever they want that is communicated through photos.</p>
<p>Instagram offers you a place to upload your photos but they take that data and then serve ads to people. They make money through this method mainly. They even share some of that revenue with an Instagram user if they have a large enough following.</p>
<p>Those ads are sometimes embedded as product placement but for the most part, people don&rsquo;t seem to mind, they just want to share their photos and get some likes!</p>
<p>The next one, FetLife, is a bit more titillating. I came across this site from reading various relationship and sex bloggers on Medium and decided to check it out. After all, sex sells!</p>
<p>Fetlife is a website focused on fetish and various kinky sex experiences with its user base. My understanding is that you create a free profile, upload photos, and then organize meetups (hookups?) with like-minded kinksters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Service + automation is a win for passive income.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a member of the site - yes, seriously - but I did do a bit of sleuthing around as to how they make their money. I came across the big driver of it, <a href=""https://fetlife.com/ads"">Ads</a> (NSFW link).</p>
<p>Reddit is another one of those free to use sites. It&rsquo;s been, by far, one of the best news, information, topics, and lifestyle aggregator sites out there. I&rsquo;m an active user on there and some of my favorite subreddits are r/castiron, r/politics, and r/wallstreetbets.</p>
<p>Reddit is a great way to find new trends and understand the Zeitgeist of your communities. It&rsquo;s a treasure trove of data! I would categorize them as an experience and learning platform because I learned a helluva lot in some subreddits that made my life better!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;do you want to clutter up your brand?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just like Fetlife and Instagram, they serve ads. However, with Reddit, a user can buy a premium account so you can get rid of the ads.</p>
<p>Granted, I don&rsquo;t know all the ways these three sites make money but on the surface, it appears to be all ad-based.</p>
<h2 id=""do-online-adssuck"">Do Online Ads Suck?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently running an experiment on my Neural Market Trends blog to see how much Google Adsense income I can earn in a month. It&rsquo;s part of my data gathering experiment into figuring out how to build a product or service for passive income.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like online ads and it&rsquo;s a big reason why I use Firefox (to screen out Ads), but I understand how much of siren call of ease of use and fast money. Just add a line of code in your templates and like magic you start making money.</p>
<p>The question becomes, do you want to clutter up your brand?</p>
<p>For me? The answer is no. I like for my content to be clean and easy to absorb. I want readers to come back for my words, not for my ads.</p>
<p>Affiliate links to products or sponsored ads are ok in my book provided the content creator/influencer actually uses them.</p>
<p>I like subscription sites a lot but it&rsquo;s imperative that it provides valuable and unique content that you can&rsquo;t get anywhere else.</p>
<p>I know that marketers and companies have been doing sponsor placed ads for a long time but they feel so corporate. I&rsquo;d rather hear what some YouTuber or Instagrammer thinks of a particular product or service.</p>
<p>Of course, this engagement has not escaped the attention of &lsquo;said marketers.&rsquo; They&rsquo;re actively recruiting those YouTubers and Instagrammers for sponsored product placements now. I get it, if you&rsquo;re Alex the French Guy (great cooking channel), you gotta be able to make money to support yourself AND your channel.</p>

<div style=""position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;"">

</div>

<p>Still, these ads feel intrusive.</p>
<h2 id=""a-product-service-or-subscription"">A Product, Service, or Subscription?</h2>
<p>The most successful passive income ideas are the ones that don&rsquo;t feel forced at all. They&rsquo;re not forced upon the reader, they don&rsquo;t feel slimy, and they&rsquo;re clean and elegant.</p>
<p>Ads don&rsquo;t make me feel that way.</p>
<p>What about making a product and selling that? Or providing a service? Maybe a subscription service like Medium?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about Medium for the moment. I pay $50 a year to be able to read toll-gated content. It&rsquo;s worth it to me because there&rsquo;s some great curated content here. It&rsquo;s turning into an obsession for me. I&rsquo;ve read and interacted with some amazing writers and thinkers there.</p>
<p>After all, why bother with all this nonsense if you don&rsquo;t have a larger goal above?</p>
<p>The best part of Medium is that writers can earn income if their content is popular and useful to readers. This article I&rsquo;m writing is in fact behind the toll-gate, and if all goes well I&rsquo;ll be earning a few bucks from my stream of consciousness thoughts.</p>
<p>Subscription sites are like a partnership between lovers, it works as long as each one of you hold up your end of the bargain. If Medium doesn&rsquo;t provide great content I like, then I&rsquo;m taking my money elsewhere.</p>
<p>I like subscription sites a lot but it&rsquo;s imperative that it provides valuable and unique content that you can&rsquo;t get anywhere else. It has to be protected and the fee has to be fair.</p>
<p>Creating a service is another idea I like. I&rsquo;ve written about Park.IO before and I like how Mike has created this very low touch and passive income site. It took him time and effort to roll everything out in the beginning but all the processes are automated now. He just has to check in every day to see how the machine is running.</p>
<p>Mike provides a valuable service to a niche market and makes money hand over fist. Of course, he has infrastructure costs but you can write those costs off on your taxes, but service + automation is a win for passive income.</p>
<p>The last item I&rsquo;ve thought about is creating a product. Whether it&rsquo;s a hard tangible product like a widget or a soft product like an ebook, it has to fill a need for a user in a particular market.</p>
<p>You want to have the biggest amount of web traffic to find your product so you can &lsquo;convert&rsquo; those eyeballs to cash.</p>
<p>This leads me back to the five (six?) topics I wrote before: sex, religion, politics, money, and experiences and learning.</p>
<p>A relationship ebook or sexual wellness product has the ability to hit all the pleasure centers of a group of interested customers. After all, sex sells. Doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about investing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Selling salvation is the cornerstone of any modern religion (Note: I have big issues about this). On the same note, selling Trump flags to a gullible electorate was also a big business for Trump. Religion and politics are horrible at how they extract wealth from the general population and large corporations. I have zero interest in those two topics and plan to never capitalize on them. </p>
<p>Writing about money topics (like passive investing) and selling an ebook is a very popular endeavor that earns some people big money. Everyone wants to make a living on the Internet (myself included).</p>
<p>Making selling educational type courses or how-to ebooks for experiences (i.e. travel the world on a shoestring budget) are also big moneymakers, and valuable.</p>
<h2 id=""investing-and-my-passive-incomedesire"">Investing and My Passive Income Desire</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve read this entire article and have gotten to this very point, you&rsquo;ll be happy to know that I&rsquo;m about to come full circle. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about investing.</p>
<p>I started my retirement accounts as early as I could. I made a lot of mistakes along the way but managed to build up a good nest egg. I&rsquo;ve written about my goal to retire at 59 (59 1/2) and generate $100,000 a year from passive income. I suspect that the majority of that income will come from stock dividends and debt (bonds) income.</p>
<p>There are a ton of caveats with this route and subject for another lengthy post, but the biggest problem with this is building up your nest egg.</p>
<p>The majority of Americans have no retirement, they&rsquo;re hoping for Social Security to pay the bills when they retire. This is a recipe for disaster and when I was young I was scared that this would happen to me. I had nightmares that I&rsquo;d be eating cat food, living in a cardboard box, on the streets of Newark NJ.</p>
<p>Then there are some Americans that have a pension. They&rsquo;re pretty lucky but the reality is that these retirement accounts are being favored out for the ever-popular and &lsquo;you&rsquo;re on your own&rsquo; 401k.</p>
<p>401k&rsquo;s and IRA&rsquo;s are the best way for regular American&rsquo;s to save for their retirement, but only if they&rsquo;re smart about it. There are tons of blogs, articles, and programs (ebooks, etc) for people to learn how to invest.</p>
<p>I started with growth stocks and funds and now I&rsquo;m transitioning to dividend-producing stocks and funds. Why? Because I had time on my side (started young) and remained invested in the markets (do less, earn more). Passive investing saved my life and it vanquished all my nightmares. </p>
<p>Note, passive investing is not the same as passive income. Passive investing is a market philosophy that diversifies your risk and keeps expenses low. Passive income is the money you make from passive investing. Get it?</p>
<p>How do you build up that nest egg? From your full-time, part-time, and side hustles. You have to pay yourself first and set it aside in a retirement account. Then add to it on a regular basis and keep your eye on the account. Then when you turn 40 or 50 you can start seeing how dividends generate income for you.</p>
<p>It started out with $25 a year and has grown - by accident - to $800 a year. That&rsquo;s $66 a month on average, by accident. Imagine if I focus on this?</p>
<p>Once again I&rsquo;ll revisit the graph from above.</p>

  alt=""Effort vs Passive Income"">
<p>Imagine if you put the effort into creating a service or product, automate it, and then invest the profits? You could turbocharge your passive income in a few years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my strategy right now. Take my nest egg and focus on the passive income. Grow that.</p>
<p>Then turbocharge it with a service or product. Take those profits and then invest them to make more passive income until one day I can retire and spend it writing to my heart&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>After all, why bother with all this nonsense if you don&rsquo;t have a larger goal above?</p>
<p>Why go through all this analysis and review if there isn&rsquo;t a  driving factor behind it all?</p>
<p>That is the goal behind my passive income goals, to build a life where I can do the things I want and NOT be tied to a cubicle or corporate chair.</p>
<p>Now the big question that&rsquo;s facing me is how do I merge the tracks together? How do I invest AND create the right product or service to provide something of value to my readers. Something that I can be proud of, inspired by, and meet my goals of early retirement.</p>

Gamestop (GME) Noise,"Sun, 07 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000","<p>Gamestop (<a href=""https://stocktwits.com/symbol/GME"">$GME</a>) has been in the news a lot lately and I’ve written three articles about it on Medium. It’s been an amazing thing to watch, the <a href=""https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/short-squeezing-gamestop-gme-3eaaeab54eda"">short squeeze that took short-seller Melvin Capital down</a> (allegedly) and how crazy the <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/"">r/WallStreetBets</a> group is.</p>
<p>I admit that I traded on all the activity and I made a tidy profit but I considered my success due to sheer luck and being at the right place at the right time. Of course, I  gave back some of my gains on <a href=""https://stocktwits.com/symbol/AMC"">$AMC</a> and <a href=""https://stocktwits.com/symbol/BB"">$BB</a>, but I consider that a ‘scratch’ and just the cost of trading. <a href=""https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/gme-amc-bb-wtf-stonks-go-up-faf711f6ef1"">Stonks go up</a>! Or do they?</p>
<p>My <a href=""https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/is-the-gamestop-gme-story-over-23fda5d90a14"">cynical self is looking at GME now</a>, reading the r/WSB chatter and on StockTwits, and I think the run is over. Maybe I’m wrong and cynical, but Wall Street is better prepared against them now. RobinHood, who doesn’t give a damn about you, is trying to survive.</p>
<p>In a <a href=""https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/keeping-customers-informed-through-market-volatility"">statement</a>, they share this tidbit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We continuously monitor the markets and make changes where necessary. In light of recent volatility, we restricted transactions for certain securities to position closing only. You can see the <a href=""https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/"">latest here</a>. We also raised margin requirements for certain securities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I completely get it, taking down the hedge funds is a personal thing for a lot of the people in r/WSB. Hell, this post and quote is poignant and resonates with me too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these “millennial blog posts”: you realize that, even if you weren’t adversely effected by the ’08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? We’re not enemies, we’re on the same side. [via <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6omry/an_open_letter_to_melvin_capital_cnbc_boomers_and/"">Reddit</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, there is a <a href=""https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/the-wall-street-rebellion-has-begun-c2cabad16410"">Wall Street Rebellion</a> happening. A financial MAGA populist crowd has formed on Reddit and they&rsquo;re gunning for blood.  I wonder if the financial elites are scared? It&rsquo;s too early to tell in my opinion but things are looking more ‘normal’ now. Only time will tell if this was nothing but a glorified and complex wealth transfer to the strong hands on Wall Street again.</p>

In re: Seattle's New Theory of Crime,"Sat, 26 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000","<h1 id=""november-14-weekend-edition"">November 14 Weekend Edition</h1>

<p>Recently I became a subscriber of the online edition of the WSJ. They were offering a sweet deal and I like to follow their business news. I tacked on a weekend delivery too.</p>

<p>On the last page of the first section of November 14th’s paper, I came across an article that made my blood boil. I immediately responded via submission of a letter to the editor. Having not heard back, I will assume that my response will remain unpublished. Therefore, I am publishing my response here on my blog now.</p>

<p>The thesis of their editorial is simple: Law and Order should rule the day and Seattle’s proposed legislation to make poverty a suitable defense for certain misdemeanors is descent into anarchy and proof of Seattle being an “anarchist jurisdiction” (so-called by former Atty. Gen. Bill Barr following unrest in 2020 and Seattle’s well-known Capital Hill Autonomous Zone). It was an article meant to fire up conservatives. It had the effect (in my mind) of firing up #45’s base, generating racism, exacerbating white Seattle’s deep fears of poverty and people of color, and moralizing against the poor. It should be a mirror we’re holding up to ourselves, questioning why there is poverty amidst plenty. The proposed legislation is a step towards the decriminalization of poverty – a noble goal.</p>

<h1 id=""quick-primer-of-the-wall-street-journal-editorial-board"">Quick primer of the Wall Street Journal editorial board</h1>

<p><a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/seattles-new-theory-of-crime-11605309361?st=njn5ejeyzgc1rtp&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink"">Seattle’s New Theory of Crime</a> is an article whose byline is <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/news/author/editorial-board"">The Editorial Board</a> (and whose twitter handle is <a href=""https://twitter.com/WSJopinion"">@WSJopinion</a>). Their biography linked to above reads like a mini manifesto courtesy of John Galt. But the board’s biography doesn’t even begin to touch on racism, crime, or poverty, which, this being the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal, has strong opinions indeed.</p>

<h1 id=""my-unpublished-response--unedited"">My unpublished response – unedited</h1>

<p>Regarding “Seattle’s New Theory of Crime” (Review, Nov. 14): the characterization by the author of the realities of life in Seattle are baseless and polemical. The author, who parrots the Atty. Gen. Barr’s abhorrently political distinction of Seattle as an “anarchist jurisdiction”, paints a mythical canvas of Seattle that, while dramatic, is farther from fact than Renaissance painters depicting scenes from the Trojan Wars. Not only is it offensive to call on business owners to “keep their plywood up” when many small businesses have been struggling due to COVID-19 – thanks to Sen. Mitch McConnell’s obstructionism in the Senate to pass additional relief to business owners and wage-earners – but it is a thinly-veiled dog whistle to right wing groups and corporate America that reifies racist views of inner-cities as full of crime and lacking in so-called “Law and Order”.</p>

<p>The riots in Seattle have been Police riots, where police waged chemical warfare against peaceful protesters for months in the wake of the disgusting murder of George Floyd in May. Neighbors near the East Precinct, including many with pre-existing conditions, elderly, and pregnant mothers, have been breathing pepper spray and tear gas all summer, as it wafted down streets and up into their windows. The violence perpetrated by the Seattle Police Department has led to open federal investigation for years.</p>

<p>The theory behind recent proposed legislature in Seattle is to provide some legal relief to the most disadvantaged people in our city and our society. Their circumstances are in no uncertain terms caused by the machinations of the unbridled worship of raw capitalism that has devastated working people in neighborhoods and cities all across America. The WSJ excitedly reports on record highs in the S&amp;P 500 and in the back pages of the same section, calls those who have had it worst “lawbreakers” and rioters. Isn’t crime profitable for S&amp;P 500 companies? Is that not what we’re celebrating when the index breaks new highs when 20 million Americans have lost their jobs and 240,000 have died because we’ve put “the economy” first?</p>

<p>Seattle is thriving. The city council is trying to make it slightly less illegal to be poor and underserved by public resources. When it’s safe to travel, I invite you to visit and see how well Seattle is doing compared to the rest of America.</p>

<h1 id=""commentary"">Commentary</h1>

<p>What an emotionally charged response! Now, this would not pass PR muster, undedited, if I were a CEO or elected official. I think that some of the pro-Seattle bias towards the end is natural hometown pride after reading an article whose sole purpose was to denigrate my city, but I didn’t intend to do so at the expense of other cities/parts of America that are struggling quite a lot worse. Especially in places where it’s not the fault of locals but of gerrymandered representation and political gridlock that has led to stagnant progress for decades. Seattle has been incredibly lucky overall. However, that very success has bred a myriad of problems such as discplacement of locals, increased segregation, and unlivably expensive rents and stagnated wages for many. We can do better.</p>

Q(uarantine) P(hysics),"Wed, 01 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000","<p>All day we’re solving a system of equations
A three body problem, f(you, me, the cat)</p>

<p>Time has all but ended as we flirt with each other’s event horizons</p>

<p>Dipping, dipping lower into an unstoppable force</p>

<p>Together forever!</p>

<p>Time has no meaning. The limit of love as our time together increases goes to infinity</p>

<p>Power. Force</p>

<p>What pulls us together? What unites us?</p>

<p>I love you with the force of a black hole</p>

<p>It’s all-consuming. The more of you I have the more of you I want. Am I addicted?</p>

<p>Robert Palmer would suggest that we might as well face it</p>

<p>Sometimes we merge, emitting a chirp of gravitational waves that echo across all of spacetime</p>

<p>Our love changes the very fabric of Minkoski Space</p>

<p>Waves of love resonating with all who encounter it ❤️</p>

<p>It moves with the speed of light</p>

<p>When we merge, it’s hot. It’s billions of atomic bombs, releasing several suns of energy and pressure</p>

<p>Infinities and zeroes, the notion of distance shatters as our theory breaks down, there’s no limit to what we can do, there’s no answer to the question, to the equation</p>

<p>No one can ever hope to understand us</p>

<p>It’s ephemeral, a blip on the cosmic timescale, but right now, it’s everything, it’s like all of time all the time every time. I’ve forgotten time. The only time I know, the only time I want, the time I need, is with you</p>

2019 Retrospective,"Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000","<h2 id=""2019-retrospective"">2019 Retrospective</h2>

<p>Well, <a href=""http://korbonits.github.io/2019/01/01/New-Years-Resolutions-2019.html"">that was ambitious</a>!</p>

<p>All in all, I did pretty well. My sailing skill increased dramatically and I continued to write albeit with less zeal. I read a lot of books, and traveled to one new country (Japan) and new parts of others (Montréal). I learned how to learn better than I had for a while.</p>

<p>The MOST important update of 2019 is that I met the love of my life (first week of 2019!), we fell in love, and planned a trip for early 2020 to propose to each other. Wasn’t even on the list. Definitely the best surprise of the year (and of my life). Renders 2019 a success no matter how you look at it. Looking forward to writing about this in a subsequent blog post :).</p>

<h3 id=""grading-myself"">Grading myself</h3>

<p>At a high level, for 2019 I had goals in the following categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reading: success/failure</li>
  <li>Writing: success/failure</li>
  <li>Travel: success</li>
  <li>Language: failure</li>
  <li>Fitness: failure</li>
  <li>Sailing: success/failure</li>
  <li>Organization: success</li>
  <li>Use less technology: success</li>
</ul>

<h4 id=""reading-successfailure"">Reading: success/failure</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Read 50 books/15,000+ pages: success</li>
  <li>Great Books, year one: failure</li>
  <li>Classic machine learning papers: failure</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2019 I read 16,918 pages of <strong>completed</strong> books on Goodreads, which is 50 books: first time hitting my goal! Here are <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/49504536-alex-korbonits?read_at=2019"">my 2019 books</a>.</p>

<p>Great Books: didn’t make any headway here. Ironically, I picked up a full set (pristine!) of the Harvard Classics, so, Hutchins and Adler have some competition for my reading attention.</p>

<p>Classic machine learning papers: this just wasn’t high on the interest list in 2019. Dropping it until further notice. I did however spend real quality time dissecting the latest NLP papers, math and all, on whiteboards or on Google Hangouts. BERT, Attention is All You Need, ELMo, etc., they were great reads but by far the better part was the sharing of knowledge with curious colleagues and friends.</p>

<h4 id=""writing-successfailure"">Writing: success/failure</h4>

<p>In early 2019, fresh off the huge NaNoWriMo tailwinds of hitting 50,000 words in late 2018, I started one of two fiction courses at <a href=""https://hugohouse.org/"">Hugo House</a>: Fiction II and Fiction III.</p>

<p>I was very invested in Fiction II but conflicts with sailing and other obligations had me missing out on Fiction III and I unfortunately withdrew from participation after workshopping a piece of flash fiction derived from one of my NaNoWriMo scenes.</p>

<p>After reading a lot of Poetry Magazine, I decided I’d like to take the trilogy of poetry courses at Hugo House when I can. Poetry suits the way I think better than the punishing detail and convention that prose requires to be readable. Writing prose is very difficult.</p>

<h4 id=""travel-success"">Travel: success</h4>

<p>Started off strong with entering 2019 in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of destinations I went to in 2019:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Puerto Vallarta, Mexico (January)</li>
  <li>Vancouver, BC, Canada (April)</li>
  <li>Japan (Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto, Himeji, Tokyo) (May)</li>
  <li>Portland, OR (June)</li>
  <li>Lopez Island, WA (July)</li>
  <li>Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Malibu (x3 for each) (August, October, November)</li>
  <li>Newport, OR (August)</li>
  <li>Chicago (September)</li>
  <li>New York City (September)</li>
  <li>Troy, NY; Lake George; Lake Champlain (September)</li>
  <li>Montréal, QC, Canada (September/October)</li>
  <li>San Francisco (November)</li>
</ul>

<p>Wow. This is perhaps the most travel I’ve done in a single calendar year. Two continents (Asia (first time!) and North America), four countries (Japan, USA, Canada, Mexico), five states (Washington, Oregon, California, Illinois, New York), two provinces (British Columbia, Quebec), and 16 flights. I traveled for weddings, conferences, romantic adventures, Thanksgiving, family birthdays, and of course sailing.</p>

<p>By far Japan was the most memorable trip (unfair competition). Can’t wait to go back. Would be nice to have gone for longer or to have gone without the sailing festivities to focus purely on traveling. Would love to spend more time in Kyoto and Tokyo, specifically. One day in Kyoto and three days in Tokyo were simply not enough, although I did manage to do and see quite a lot in those days with friends as well as on my own. Could not have done it without one of my college friends acting as the Virgil to my Dante helping me carve out a semi-optimal path through these complex cities. Food was the main anchor point followed by Shinto Shrines and long walks.</p>

<h4 id=""language-failure-with-computer-language-success"">Language: failure (with computer language success)</h4>

<p>Knowing at the outset of 2019 that I’d be in Japan for a fortnight in May, I had a lot of motivation to learn Japanese. I tried duolingo for awhile but I felt like I was missing a lot of structure and it was a steep learning curve. I think lessons or Rosetta Stone would have been a better choice. In retrospect, it was so easy to get around Japan because everything is so LOGICAL there. Train stations in particular. Even in places where English signage was de minimus or nonexistent, it was easy to navigate. Having a lot of wifi to use Google Maps helped too, obviously, but English wasn’t really necessary for that either. Place names and the ability to interpret symbols on maps or signs was all one needed to be successful. Most practically, knowing how to politely greet, thank, and ask simple questions was important. Food names second. I tried hard not to take advantage of the privilege of being a native English speaker and an American too much in order to get around and ask for help. In being able to communicate so little I had this wonderful experience of having to communicate what was absolutely essential in a minimalistic way. It forced me to be thoughtful about information, expression, and voice. It was isolating <strong>and</strong> liberating. It made me crave learning language so I could talk to locals and share human connection. It made traveling to Japan (which is obviously a very safe place with best-in-the-world ameninites and infrastructure) feel so much more foreign, new, and different, but still within my comfort zone. I loved it. It made me feel more open to more foreign-feeling places in the future.</p>

<p>That being said, I <em>did</em> spend a lot of time studying computer science in 2019 and learned how to write a lot of cool algorithms from scratch. That was dollar-per-minute some of the best time I’ve invested in myself. Not all self-investment has to be monetary but it helped me make a quantum leap.</p>

<p>Computer languages are much easier than natural languages but I will give myself some partial credit.</p>

<h4 id=""fitness-failure-w-sailing-success"">Fitness: failure (w/ sailing success)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Run 365 miles in 2019: failure</li>
  <li>Stretch goal 1: enter some races, starting with a 5k: failure</li>
  <li>Stretch goal 2: new PRs for distance, mile, and 5k.: failure</li>
  <li>Yoga: try it out, see if it sticks: failure</li>
  <li>Lose 10lbs sustainably: failure</li>
</ul>

<p>2019 was not my strong suit for fitness. I probably spent the most focus on steps/day. My average steps/day in 2019 were 7,898 which is quite remarkable. It was my default form of exercise and I often went on walks after work for an hour or more, listening to books. Plus walking to/from work. And walking during all that travel. I did not work on aerobic fitness and certainly didn’t push myself in 2019. Work was stressful and walking was relaxing/calming. I also used the sauna quite a bit and regularly completed the executive triathlon (dry sauna + steam room + jacuzzi) with religious zeal.</p>

<h4 id=""sailing-success"">Sailing: success</h4>

<p>Racing:</p>

<p>2019 was a banner year for sailing. It was hard to get onto fast boats as a crew person (lack of sailing resume, preparation, and networking) but I did do some fantastic networking and proved myself as capable rail meat, spinnaker trimmer, and “mast” person on some of those fast boat races. I really honed my main trim and jib/spinnaker trimming abilities on J22s and J24s. Got a lot of practice on other boats too in those positions. All that being said I also enjoyed myself a lot. And stretched myself. Did some white-knuckle racing in squalls and almost gale-force winds on a very tippy Tiger 10 – got to hang on to stay on.</p>

<p>Specifically, I trained for the Takarabune Regatta, which is a regatta between the Suma Yacht Club of Kobe, Japan, and the Seattle Yacht Club of Seattle, WA (of which I am a member). It was an honor to be chosen to crew on a boat in this regatta. Unforgettable trip to Japan and raced against great sailors (and our hosts) in Kobe. Can’t wait to see them again in 2022 in Seattle.</p>

<p>Cruising:</p>

<p>Didn’t really do this. s/v Wind Child is not in good shape for cruising, and frankly, I don’t have the skills nor interest in DIY’ing her into cruising shape. Frankly I think I’m destined to outgrow her and find a larger, newer sailboat with more comfortable amenities. The idea of cruising for months in the summer with a WiFi hotspot to do work sounds really great.</p>

<h4 id=""organization-2019-success"">Organization, 2019: success</h4>

<p>Throughout the year I became progressively more organized. I had many more demands on my time from a variety of existing and new sources and had to stay organized to keep it all together. I failed to read Part II of Getting Things Done, but I still kept up the spirit of Part I by using my personal Trello as a kanban board. If you’re not wasting time it’s amazing how much you can get done if you keep your time well-organized.</p>

<h4 id=""use-less-technology-2019-success"">Use less technology, 2019: success</h4>

<p>Speaking of wasting less time, I’d say that’s definitely true of 2019. Screen time was down. I spent more time reading, more time outside, more time traveling (and without internet in foreign places), and more time spending time with others &lt;3. At some point in the year I read Cal Newport’s <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Minimalism-Choosing-Focused-Noisy/dp/0525536515"">Digital Minimalism</a> and deleted Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook from my phone. Though sometimes I continued to log in via Chrome or Safari, the lack of push notifiactions alone drastically reduced my usage and the increased friction/reduced UX also helped reduce my time spent doomscrolling. I would highly recommend this approach. Just removing one’s access altogether or making it slightly more cumbersome. Time is the most valuable commodity I have and choosing to spend less of it on social media has made me feel happier.</p>

New Year's Resolutions 2019,"Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000","<h2 id=""a-year-back-a-year-ahead"">A year back, a year ahead.</h2>

<p>Below, you’ll find a 2018 retrospective.</p>

<p>Here, you’ll find my new goals for 2019. I looked forward to making them all year. It’s fun to look back on the last year and my crazy goals. It’s amazing to see not only what I’ve accomplished, but what I’ve failed to do. That is clarifying. The last year shows what mattered to me and what didn’t. Goals, of course, are not all-encompassing of life. This is not the Truman show. These are all measurable, attainable goals mostly related to learning and staying in shape – they are not meant to represent professional or interpersonal goals.</p>

<p>High-level summary of 2019 resolutions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reading</li>
  <li>Writing</li>
  <li>Travel</li>
  <li>Language</li>
  <li>Fitness</li>
  <li>Sailing</li>
  <li>Organization</li>
  <li>Use less technology</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=""reading-2019"">Reading, 2019</h2>

<p>Last year’s reading goals were only <em>slightly</em> overprescribed. Lol.</p>

<p><img src=""/assets/le_bar_bibliotheque.jpg"" alt=""St. James, Paris"" /></p>

<p>A photo of me in the library bar at <a href=""https://www.saint-james-paris.com/"">St. James</a> in Paris, reading <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_from_Underground""><em>Notes from Underground</em></a>, by Dostoevsky.</p>

<p>Shortlist of goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Read 50 books, again (OKR-style)</li>
  <li>The Great Books, continued</li>
  <li>Classic machine learning papers</li>
  <li>Short stories; poetry</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=""read-50-books"">Read 50 books</h3>

<p>By OKR standards, I knocked this one out of the park in 2018. By that logic, I should consider upping my goal for next year. That being said, I don’t need to read any <em>more</em> books in 2019 – I spent time reading at the expense of other activities (especially fitness). Rather than lowering the goal, I will keep it at 50. In the same way that the Economist has 50 issues per year (and takes off 2 weeks at the end of every year), the goal of 50 is a reasonable “one book per week” with some wiggle-room to take a couple of weeks off.</p>

<p>By wasting less time in 2019, I think I can still balance fitness and reading goals.</p>

<p><strong>2019-01-04 update:</strong> This should go without saying, but, as a privileged white cis-het male, I feel it is my duty to represent the following. In 2019 I will commit to reading books/stories/poetry written by women, POC, nonbinary folks, and other underrepresented author identities or authors from less privileged backgrounds. These works will stand for themselves and I will not review them as conveniently fitting into some sort of diversity category/genre, as if I am checking off a box. I think this is important and I think everyone else should do the same.</p>

<h3 id=""great-books-year-one-and-two"">Great Books, year one and two</h3>

<p><img src=""/assets/great_books.jpg"" alt=""The Great Books"" /></p>

<p>Here is a Great Books <a href=""https://gbwwblog.wordpress.com/reading-plan/"">reading plan</a>. Year two doesn’t look so bad. One thing I like about this breakdown is that it includes page counts (though it’s really double this count since they are large double-column pages in tiny print)</p>

<p>By the end of 2019, I’d like to commit to having read all of year one and year two of the great books. This sounds ridiculous since I only got halfway through year one in 2018, but I’m willing to sacrifice a few books from my Goodreads list this year if it means completing this goal <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">#tradeoffs</code>.</p>

<h3 id=""classic-machine-learning-papers"">Classic machine learning papers</h3>

<p><img src=""/assets/lstm.png"" alt=""LSTM"" /></p>

<p>This is a pictorial representation of an <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.676.4320&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"">LSTM</a><sup id=""fnref:0"" role=""doc-noteref""><a href=""#fn:0"" class=""footnote"">1</a></sup> cell.</p>

<p>Refer to <a href=""http://korbonits.github.io/2018/01/05/New-Years-Resolutions.html"">last year’s paper list</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to keeping up with the state of the art in machine learning in 2019, I would like to fill in some of the foundational gaps in my knowledge by reading classic papers. Over the years, I have also acquired a fairly comprehensive library of machine learning references texts and textbooks.</p>

<p>Stretch goal: read &gt;= 1 machine learning textbook in 2019.</p>

<h3 id=""short-stories-poetry"">Short stories; poetry</h3>

<p>This year, I’d like to gain exposure to forms of writing that are newer to me. Instead of focusing on scientific papers (i.e., in <em>Nature</em>) or timely long-reads on foreign relations (i.e., in <em>Foreign Affairs</em>), I’d like to read more contemporary short stories and poetry. This is also to help me with my writing goals – a double win. I’m a subscriber of <a href=""https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine""><em>Poetry Magazine</em></a> and intend to subscribe to one or more additional (usually quarterly) literary magazines (probably <a href=""https://www.theparisreview.org/""><em>The Paris Review</em></a>). Staying current with what is being published today will be crucial for my writing career. The measurable goal for 2019 is to read short stories/poetry monthly.</p>

<h2 id=""writing-2019"">Writing, 2019</h2>

<p><img src=""/assets/nanowrimo.png"" alt=""nanowrimo"" /></p>

<p>NaNoWriMo was so fun in 2018, I’d like to do it again in 2019. That’s the first goal.</p>

<p>Second goal is to continue taking writing courses at Hugo House, time permitting. I’m taking a fiction-writing course this winter and would like to take a revision course in the spring.</p>

<p>Third goal is to keep writing all year. Doesn’t need to be in the form of blog posts, but just needs to be a regular (ideally daily) habit.</p>

<p>Stretch goals for 2019:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finish manuscript for novel based on nanowrimo 2018</li>
  <li>Get published (could be short story, poetry, essay – something less ambitious than a novel)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=""travel-2019"">Travel, 2019</h2>

<p><img src=""/assets/tokyo.jpg"" alt=""Tokyo"" /></p>

<p>Travel in 2019 is off to a good start. I began the new year in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Travel goal for 2019 is visiting at least one new country. Right now I’m going to Japan in May to go sailing (double win!).</p>

<p>Note to friends: get hitched in exotic locations – I’ll be there.</p>

<h2 id=""language-2019"">Language, 2019</h2>

<p><img src=""/assets/hiragana.jpg"" alt=""kanji"" /></p>

<p>This is a new goal. Last year, it was just to “practice French”. I am going to focus on learning a new language in 2019.</p>

<p>After much consideration (and great conversations on Facebook), I will commit to learning Japanese ahead of my trip in May.</p>

<p>Following Japan, unless I want to continue learning Japanese, I think I will focus on the <a href=""http://www.un.org/en/sections/about-un/official-languages/"">six official languages</a> of the United Nations. Perhaps in the future my preferences will change, but there’s already a lifetime of language learning with that list.</p>

<p>Having just acquired a copy of <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Babel-Around-World-Twenty-Languages/dp/0802128793/""><em>Babel: Around the World in Twenty Languages</em></a>, by Gaston Dorren, I’d need to know the twenty that Dorren describes to be able to converse in the mother tongues of just half of the world’s population. I’d like to know how many (and which) languages would allow me to talk to a majority of humanity even if it’s someone’s 2nd, 3rd, or Nth language (this will likely dramatically reduce the number from twenty to the single digits).</p>

<h2 id=""fitness-2019"">Fitness, 2019</h2>

<p>Going to keep this one simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run 365 miles in 2019</li>
  <li>Stretch goal 1: enter some races, starting with a 5k</li>
  <li>Stretch goal 2: new PRs for distance, mile, and 5k.</li>
  <li>Yoga: try it out, see if it sticks</li>
  <li>Lose 10lbs sustainably</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=""sailing-2019"">Sailing, 2019</h2>

<p><img src=""/assets/spinnaker.jpg"" alt=""spinnaker"" /></p>

<p>Racing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Skip/crew for some casual races (e.g., Goosebumps, Kirkland summer sailing series)</li>
  <li>Crew for some serious races (Tri-Island, Swiftsure, Grand Prix, Round the County)</li>
</ul>

<p>Cruising:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sail to the San Juans</li>
  <li>Sail to nearby ports of call (e.g., Poulsbo)</li>
  <li>Stretch goal: sail to Canada</li>

<p>Last year I was just aiming to get out on the water. Thanks to the wonderful, welcoming people in Seattle’s sailing community, I blew last year’s goal out of the water, as it were. This year, I am going to do some cruising and do some serious racing.</p>

<p>Vic/Maui 2020, anyone?</p>

<h2 id=""organization-2019"">Organization, 2019</h2>

<p>Implementing Part I of <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563"">Getting Things Done</a> in 2018 went well, but I can do better.</p>

<p>This year, let’s start by finishing it and using organization as a tool to not just keep track of things, but to save time planning and create more time to achieve my goals. Yesterday I was reading <a href=""https://www.theparisreview.org/""><em>The Paris Review</em></a> and in an author interview, the topic of plotting vs. pantsing was discussed. In her career, the author has been a pantser, but she said that a little bit of planning can save a lot of time during composition (first draft) and subsequent revisions. Organization to save time. That’s my goal for 2019.</p>

<h2 id=""use-less-technology-2019"">Use less technology, 2019</h2>

<p>By use less technology, I really mean waste less time. The screen time app is a blessing and a curse, because it creates guilt. Let’s eliminate that in 2019. I want to spend less time watching television, movies, and wasting time on the internet. Scrolling through social media, etc. Time is something you can’t buy.</p>

<p>Therefore, I will commit to using technology less in 2019 and commit to spending my time taking care of my body, exploring the world, reading, writing, and being with people. I can track this with screen time, and try to create habits that disincentivize using technology.</p>

<h2 id=""2018-retrospective"">2018 Retrospective</h2>

<p>Well, <a href=""http://korbonits.github.io/2018/01/05/New-Years-Resolutions.html"">that was ambitious</a>.</p>

<p>All in all, I did pretty well. Two major new hobbies emerged: writing prose and sailing. I read a lot of books, and traveled to two new countries (England and Portugal). I learned how to learn better than I had for a while.</p>

<h3 id=""grading-myself"">Grading myself</h3>

<p>At a high level, for 2018 I had goals in the following categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reading: success/failure</li>
  <li>Writing: success</li>
  <li>Travel: success</li>
  <li>Fitness: failure (w/ sailing success)</li>
  <li>Less television: success</li>
  <li>Optimize volunteering: failure</li>
  <li>Themes (organization): success/failure</li>
</ul>

<h4 id=""reading-successfailure"">Reading: success/failure</h4>

<p>This was the toughest goal (other than fitness).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read 50 books/15,000+ pages: success</li>
  <li>Great Books, year one: failure</li>
  <li>Classic machine learning papers: failure</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2018 I read 14,564 pages of <strong>completed</strong> books on Goodreads, which is 47 books – definitely a success by OKR standards, and including The Great Books I read well over 15,000 pages. Hot damn. I pretty much read things in all of the categories I mentioned, but I mostly stuck to fiction. Here are <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/49504536-alex-korbonits?read_at=2018"">my 2018 books</a>.</p>

<p>Great Books: I got really bored in the middle of Saint Augustine and sort of failed to continue. I’ll hold over this goal from last year.</p>

<p>Classic machine learning papers: I read some of them, but not methodically. I did read a lot of machine learning papers in 2018, in particular the word embedding canon since 2013. I’ll carry this goal over into 2019.</p>

<h4 id=""writing-success"">Writing: success</h4>

<p>Can you say NaNoWriMo ten times quickly?</p>

<p>This is a goal I put off until August. I ostensibly failed at this given the explicit subgoals, but I succeeded beyond my wildest dreams of a year ago. In late August/early September, I started taking a <a href=""https://hugohouse.org/classes/the-writers-welcome-kit/"">Writer’s Welcome Kit</a> class at <a href=""http://hugohouse.org"">Hugo House</a>, both a class and an institution I can’t recommend highly enough. This began when I was feeling a bit behind on my writing goal for the year. I’m so glad I took the plunge. I spend almost two months writing about 1000 words per diem on single word prompts, and used a website I found via HackerNews called <a href=""http://writingstreak.io"">writingstreak.io</a> to help track my progress. It was great for establishing a writing habit, however, I’m thinking of switching to Scrivener for larger projects or Evernote for everyday writing. Right now I’m using <a href=""https://www.sublimetext.com/"">Sublime</a> and the command line for most of my writing. Sublime is the editor in which I write all of my code, including the markdown for this post, so for me it is a natural writing setting.</p>

<p>In November I took a class on Novel Immersion through Hugo House, which was contemporaneous with <a href=""http://nanowrimo.com"">NaNoWriMo</a>, short for National Novel Writing Month. A “winner” is someone who, in the month of November, completes (or begins, really) a 50,000 word manuscript of fiction. Anecdotally this is around 200-250 pages depending on the amount of dialogue. In short: I won! I learned a lot about getting words OUT in the months preceding NaNoWriMo (and I’m so glad I practiced), but the class really helped me focus on how to think about story, plot, character, dialogue, and voice in an immersive, accelerated fashion.</p>

<p>I’m a <a href=""https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Pantser"">pantser</a> – it’s the only thing I know.</p>

<p>Next year I’m going to learn how to edit, learn more about poetry, and try to complete the novel I began in November. Maybe make some submissions and try out other forms of writing.</p>

<h4 id=""travel-success"">Travel: success</h4>

<p>Not only did I spend two weeks in France (with a 3-day jaunt to jolly old England), but I spent another week in Portugal (two days in Lisbon and four in the Algarve). So I went to 2 new countries. I also practiced French before I went. I was complimented by the French on my French deux fois during my trip there. That’s all I needed to hear.</p>

<h4 id=""fitness-failure-w-sailing-success"">Fitness: failure (w/ sailing success)</h4>

<p>As for personal training, lifting, and running, I did pretty well during the first half of 2018. But when I cut personal training to focus on sailing, that’s when my fitness went downhill. For 2019 I’ll cut down on my goals to make them more attainable and focused. It wasn’t all for naught, however.</p>

<p>Sailing: great success. This really deserves to be under its own heading. Who would have known that sailing would become such a passion? I started racing in the bitter cold (and snow) of winter in January and February. I started sailing almost weekly on Lake Union/Lake Washington throughout the spring. I crewed in many races (Frostbite, Goosebumps, Tri-Island, Dock Dodge, Kirkland). I acquired a sailboat! WTF. I learned so much about sailing in 2018. There’s so much more. My goal of entering one race and sailing 1x/month was blown out of the water before the first half of 2018. Most importantly, I made great friends in the sailing community. Sailors are the best.</p>

<p>Racing/tracking/autocross: failure, but let’s call it “deferred”. I optimized my weekends (especially in the summer) around sailing. I can do this in 2019. It’ll be a carry-over, but not an explicit goal for 2019. It just wasn’t a priority.</p>

<h4 id=""less-television-success"">Less television: success</h4>

<p>I did watch less television (and fewer movies) in 2018 but it was not as though I eliminated it. Things I watched in 2018:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Seinfeld</li>
  <li>Frasier (8/11 of it)</li>
  <li>Billions</li>
  <li>Silicon Valley</li>
  <li>Mozart in the Jungle</li>
  <li>Vanity Fair (miniseries)</li>
  <li>Bleak House (BBC miniseries).</li>
</ul>

<p>Many audiobooks were missed during the viewing of these TV shows.</p>

<p>Two GREAT movies I saw in 2018 (not new) were both at <a href=""https://cinerama.com/"">Cinerama</a> as part of their 70mm film festival. Lawrence of Arabia. 2001: A Space Odyssey. Amazing experiences.</p>

<h4 id=""optimize-volunteering-failure"">Optimize volunteering: failure</h4>

<p>I failed at this. Here’s hope for 2019. Not a complete failure. I became proficient on 2 committees on which I serve, which is great. In 2019 I need to say no to too much and work with others to take my place. It’s time to move on from a couple of engagements through which I’ve learned much and have made many great friends.</p>

<h4 id=""themes-successfailure"">Themes: success/failure</h4>

<p>What the hell is “themes,” you ask? Organization was the main theme. Even though I didn’t finish reading <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563"">Getting Things Done</a>, I got part one down quite well. I used Trello all year to keep track of things. Not perfectly… but that wasn’t the point. I tracked things all year on boards, and used them to track many of the things on my 2018 resolutions. <strong>I made my 2018 New Years Resolutions last all year</strong> – I kept them in mind throughout 2018. That’s a success for organization. It’s not all roses. I failed in some respects. At times my Trello boards became bloated and/or outdated. I am still a procrastinator for things like making appointments for things that take place during the week – seems like a waste of time to be out of the office. In 2019, I will do better.</p>

New Year's Resolutions 2018,"Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000","<h2 id=""hold-me-accountable"">Hold me accountable</h2>

<p>This year, I propose the following set of New Year’s Resolutions. I am posting this subset of my goals publically so you can hold me accountable. I’ll do a retrospective at the end of 2018, and try to keep this list updated with progress throughout the year. I’m using Trello to keep track in real time.</p>

<p>Importantly, in this post I focus on personal, not-strictly-professional goals. Undoubtedly, many of my 2018 goals are professional, and many of my outside-of-work activities are professional in nature and directly or indirectly benefit my professional life. To me, it goes without saying that I intend to craft, measure, track, and achieve professional goals throughout the year. In terms of specifics, most of those are internal to where I work. This post is about “fun stuff outside of work that I can share” :). Furthermore, I’m not going to include things that I’ll do anyway like see new art exhibits, go to concerts, or other cultural events.</p>

<p>Here is my Goodreads profile if you want to see what I finished <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2017/49504536"">in 2017</a> and <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2016/49504536"">in 2016</a>.</p>

<p>High level summary of 2018 resolutions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reading</li>
  <li>Writing</li>
  <li>Travel</li>
  <li>Fitness</li>
  <li>Less television</li>
  <li>Optimize volunteering</li>
  <li>Themes</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=""reading"">Reading</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Read 50 books/15,000-20,000 pages (tracking with Goodreads)</li>
  <li>Read year 1 of the 10 year reading plan of Great Books of the Western World</li>
  <li>Read all papers in Microsoft Research’s “Paper Legend: Artificial Intelligence Edition” card game</li>
</ul>

<p>This year I am going to change it up in terms of my reading goals. Last year I took an ambitious goal of reading 50 books. By Google OKR standards, I hit 76%, which is quite a success! I liked this goal because it was easy to track and kept me motivated throughout the year. I may have hit 50 had I spent the first half of 2017 on-target, second, I spent about a month without finishing a book in Q4 as I transitioned from one job to another.</p>

<p>“Number of books read” is not the best metric, in my opinion. Example: <em>War and Peace</em> != <em>Hamlet</em>. This metric is easy to game by reading smaller books. I recall making some tradeoffs this fall where, trying to select a next book to read, I looked for the shortest book in my library I hadn’t read yet. Essentially, this metric penalizes you for reading longer works and rewards you for reading shorter works.</p>

<p>“Number of pages read”, a metric that Goodreads shows (based on the public information about the books you shelve), is much better for comparing <em>War and Peace</em> with <em>Hamlet</em>. In 2017, I read (i.e., finished) 38 books. This turns out to be about 14,500 pages according to Goodreads. That’s about 382 pages/book and a reading pace of about 40 pages/day. This metric is still not perfect, however. It doesn’t take into account the heterogeneity of writing styles and, perhaps more importantly, speed of comprehension. For example, some contemporary writing reads so well it could be a movie screenplay. Many such books are adapted into films. Some books, like <em>Ready Player One</em>, are captivating page-turners that one can read in a single sitting. However, some books, like a mathematics textbook (with proofs) or philosophy, read much, much slower. One of the reasons I find fiction so easy to read is that, by suspending disbelief, it’s easy to get sucked in and follow along in a very immersive manner. One <em>could</em> do a close reading of any fiction and spend much more time dissecting it, but for pure entertainment, it’s easy to proceed quickly. Reading math, philosophy, or scientific papers is much more demanding on the reader. Not only is the information contained in these formats much higher in terms of density (e.g., mathematical notation), but following the logic is intrinsically a very demanding task. Reading in these formats is highly non-linear (in terms of progressing from beginning to end). One is constantly looking up terms, searching in indices, reading cited papers, re-reading paragraphs, stopping to think, etc. “Number of pages” is still not the perfect metric for measuring reading.</p>

<p>What’s a perfect metric? I’m not really sure. I think a metric along the lines of “elapsed time reading in a flow-like state”<sup id=""fnref:0"" role=""doc-noteref""><a href=""#fn:0"" class=""footnote"">1</a></sup> is probably a democratic one. That’s harder to track unless you make tracking it a very strong habit. For 2018, I think I’ll stick to number of books read as a high-level proxy and formulate multiple reading subgoals to round things out.</p>

<h3 id=""50-books15000-20000-pages"">50 books/15,000-20,000 pages</h3>

<p><img src=""/assets/2017-books.png"" alt=""Some 2017 books"" /></p>

<p>Usually this goal is haphazard in its selection (c.f. my Goodreads of 2016 and 2017). Should I be more prescriptive this year? Let’s do this: I’ll suggest several focus areas but won’t commit to specific books.</p>

<p>Areas of particular focus:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ML textbooks (e.g., <em>ESL</em>)</li>
  <li>Programming textbooks (e.g., <em>SICP</em>)</li>
  <li>Math textbooks (e.g., <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XHZ82GF""><em>Category Theory in Context</em></a>)</li>
  <li>Classic literature (e.g., <em>Moby Dick</em>)</li>
  <li>Contemporary literary fiction (e.g., <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Commonwealth-Novel-Ann-Patchett/dp/0062491830""><em>Commonwealth</em></a>)</li>
  <li>History (e.g., <a href=""https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10302.html""><em>The Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women across the Ancient World</em></a>)</li>
  <li>Economics (e.g., <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CJUV2J6""><em>The Economic History of China: From Antiquity to the Nineteenth Century</em></a>)</li>
  <li>Philosophy (e.g., <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Reasons-Persons-Derek-Parfit/dp/019824908X""><em>Reasons and Persons</em></a>)</li>
  <li>Scientific biographies (e.g., <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M5IJN1P""><em>A Mind at Play: How Claude Shannon Invented the Information Age</em></a>)</li>
  <li><a href=""https://www.nature.com/nature/"">Nature</a> (print subscription)</li>
  <li><a href=""https://www.foreignaffairs.com/"">Foreign Affairs</a> (print subscription)</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-goals (these go without saying – I will read these to some extent anyway):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reading the news</li>
  <li>Reading  ML conference papers (or prominent non-conference papers on arXiv)</li>
  <li>Reading papers that aren’t ML-related and aren’t published in Nature</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional thoughts: one of the tools I used to help me through certain books in 2017 was by listening to audiobooks on Audible. Audible, while representing a small minority of books I “read” in 2017, was significant because it exposed me to my first audiobook experiences. I was able to “read” more in 2017 than I otherwise would have because I could multi-task and listen to an audiobook, say, while I was washing my dishes or going for a walk. Reading actively is still more enjoyable to me than listening passively. It depends on the book, but in general I’d say I recall more from books I read than from books I listened to. Audible does have some gems such as Ian McKellan reading <em>The Odyssey</em>. You are in for a treat.</p>

<h3 id=""the-great-books-year-1"">The Great Books, Year 1</h3>

<p><img src=""/assets/plato-academy.jpg"" alt=""Plato's academy"" /></p>

<p>One of my reading sub-goals in 2018 is to start systematically attacking my copy of the Great Books. In volume 1, “The Great Conversation”, there’s a 10 year reading plan laid out by the main editors, Robert Maynard Hutchins and Mortimer Adler. I’ve read many of the works suggested for the first year before but I will willingly re-read them.</p>

<p>Here is the recommended reading list for year one of the Great Books:</p>

<p>Of these, I’ve read Plato, Aristotle, half of Aristophanies, 2/5 of Plutarch (Caesar and Alexander, obvi.), the new testament, St. Augustine, Machiavelli, Shakespeare, Lock, Rousseau, American founding documents (but not the Federalist papers), and the Communist Manifesto. It has been many years since I’ve read these, however, and I’m eagerly looking forward to re-reading all of them as I enter a new decade of life and prepare for year 2 of The Great Books.</p>

<h3 id=""paper-legend-artifical-intelligence-edition"">Paper Legend: Artifical Intelligence Edition</h3>

<p>This resolution is inspired by my attendance at NIPS 2017. Microsoft was a sponsor and gave out these nerdy-looking card packs as swag. I’ve read some of these papers already but in 2018 I will make a concerted effort to “catch them all” especially seeing that I’ve learned a lot of ML since I began reading some of the papers on this list (c.f. AlexNet).</p>

<h2 id=""writing"">Writing</h2>

<p><img src=""/assets/Rosetta_Stone.JPG"" alt=""Heterogeneous writing"" /></p>

<p>In 2018, I am going to take on writing goals. Here’s my list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blogging: &gt;= 12 blog posts (1x/month) [1/12]</li>
  <li>Speaking: &gt;= 1 public speaking event (under writing because it’s putting together a talk) [0/1]</li>
  <li>NIPS workshop submission (this is pretty ambitious, I need to scope)</li>
  <li>Music composition (string quartet – likely a single movement), to be premiered for my 30th birthday.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that I would like to do some other writing-related things like successfully contribute to an open source software project or begin to write a book, but those need more scoping before I could take such goals on.</p>

<p>One of the best things I did in 2017 was attend NIPS. I am inspired by all of the brilliant research occuring in machine learning and I want to contribute. I think if I had to pick a workshop to contribute to this year it would be for the creativity workshop. I think a workshop submission would be a great gateway for a 2019+ goal of successfully submitting and being chosen as part of the NIPS conference proceedings. Who’s with me?</p>

<h2 id=""travel"">Travel</h2>

<p><img src=""/assets/Monaco_City_001.jpg"" alt=""Monaco"" /></p>

<p>This year I will be heading back to Paris for the first time since I was 17. I’d like to bone up on my French, which is rusty as of 2006, and I’d like to visit a new country… perhaps the one shown in the photo above?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Visit &gt;= 1 new country</li>
  <li>Practice French</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=""fitness"">Fitness</h2>

<p><img src=""/assets/Long_Distance_Runners,_Ancient_Greece,_Amphora.png"" alt=""Running"" /></p>

<p>As I enter a new decade of life, I want to add a focus on physical fitness. In 2017 I started regularly working with a personal trainer and it has been a great start to being fit. That being said, it isn’t enough. I need to take some attainable yet challenging and measurable goals. Challenging especially if I fall behind (see running goal).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Personal training 1x/week [1/52]</li>
  <li>Lifting 1x/week (in addition to training) [1/52]</li>
  <li>Go sailing &gt;= 1x/month [0/12]</li>
  <li>Enter &gt;= 1 sailboat race [0/1]</li>
  <li>Run a 5k race (I have subgoals to get to this) [0/1]</li>
  <li>Run 365 miles in 2018 (&gt;= 1 mile/day) [1/365]</li>
  <li>Lose 10 lbs., sustainably</li>
  <li>Do yoga &gt;= 1x in January; &gt;= 1x/month after if I enjoy it</li>
  <li>Climb Mt. Pilchuk [0/1]</li>
</ul>

<p>Stretch goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Win &gt;= 1 sailboat race</li>
  <li>Take (car) racing lessons</li>
  <li>Enter &gt;= 1 autocross</li>
</ul>

<p>Why include sailing and autocross into fitness? I think because they’re both sports, they both require skill, and they frankly require one to be physically fit to perform well. Why put autocross under stretch goals? 2018 is going to be busy, and there are some racing prerequisites I’d like to take care of before I do autocross. Let’s just say I need to take some racing lessons. My high-school obsession, <em>Gran Tourismo</em>, is likely inadequate for tracking my own car.</p>

<h2 id=""less-television"">Less television</h2>

<p>Looking back on 2017, perhaps the main hindrance to achieving my full reading goal (truly my only 2017 resolution) was due to the number of hours I spent streaming television shows on Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Hulu.</p>

<p>Clearly, this time wasn’t spent <em>too</em> memorably because I can’t remember all of the shows I watched in 2017. Notably, I caught up with some of my favorites:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Game of Thrones (all 7 seasons, hadn’t seen any as of July 2017)</li>
  <li>Billions</li>
  <li>Mozart in the Jungle</li>
  <li>Silicon Valley</li>
  <li>Will &amp; Grace (original and new)</li>
  <li>The Handmaid’s Tale</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Game of Thrones</em> and <em>Will &amp; Grace</em> are each &gt; 7 seasons, so this is a lot of television in 2017. I don’t plan on binge-watching anything in 2018 except for perhaps new seasons of <em>Billions</em>, <em>Mozart in the Jungle</em>, <em>Silicon Valley</em>, and <em>Stranger Things</em> if I can be persuaded.</p>

<h2 id=""optimize-volunteering"">Optimize volunteering</h2>

<p>Optimize is the key word here. I don’t intend to eliminate, reduce, or increase volunteer activities in 2018, rather, I intend to optimize them. Right now I am stretched fairly thin on volunteer activities, most of which are new as of 2017. They’re all important to me, but some take a disproportionate amount of time to manage performantly, and I need to reallocate some of that time to others. That will require learning and evolving skills such as handing off responsibilities and relinquishing control. Overall, 2017 was a great year in terms of volunteer opportunities for me. I experienced new kinds of volunteering for 3 different organizations, all of which have been rewarding and unique. For specifics you can refer to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/korbonits/"">my LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>

<h2 id=""themes"">Themes</h2>

<p>Dude, you’ve got a lot of goals for 2018. What’s the unifying theme? You’re all over the place?</p>

<p>One of the unifying themes for my 2018 goals is <strong>organization</strong>. Merely writing down my main (albeit varied) interests is a good starting point. Second, trying to come up with reasonable but not-attainable-without-effort goals for them is crucial because it forces me to do more than the status quo. Third, plurality. It’s easy to take a couple of goals that one can game, but singular focus is boring (to me). Fourth, accountability. Fifth, doing/trying new things: I’ve never been much of a runner or a hiker (while I have gone through spurts, they’ve never been long-lived), so these goals (like run &gt;= 365 miles or climb Mt. Pilchuk) are new and designed to create habits rather than stand in as mere bucket-list items.</p>

<p>By the end of 2018, I’d love sing (in a major key): <strong>QED</strong>.</p>

  <li>Deep learning is influencing bayesian methods and vice versa: deep bayesian learning and bayesian deep learning are two slightly different subfields with extremely rapid progress this year.

  <li>Not only is model interpretability, bias, and fairness on people’s minds, but there’s also a lot of attention and research in this rapidly-developing area right now. Kate Crawford gave an excellent invited talk about bias and fairness in machine learning which paved the conversation for the rest of the week, including in several papers, symposia, and workshops.

<ol>
  <li>Deep learning is influencing bayesian methods and vice versa: deep bayesian learning and bayesian deep learning are two slightly different subfields with extremely rapid progress this year. Expect to see a lot more developement in this area. There was a great workshop on these topics and I predict there will soon be benchmark datasets and a growing base of open source software for folks to use. Neural networks can make brittle predictions – how can we quantify their uncertainty better? Gaussian processes can be composed together to create richer models – how do we leverage tools used in deep learning to make using GPs easier and more performant?
1.1 See <a href=""https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/"">Yee Whye Teh’s</a> talk, <a href=""https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017/Schedule?showEvent=8726"">On Bayesian Deep Learning and Deep Bayesian Learning</a> for more info. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/nipsfoundation/videos/1555493854541848/"">Video link</a>.</li>
  <li>Not only is model interpretability, bias, and fairness on people’s minds, but there’s also a lot of attention and research in this rapidly-developing area right now. Kate Crawford gave an excellent invited talk about bias and fairness in machine learning which paved the conversation for the rest of the week, including in several papers, symposia, and workshops. This is not just an area where the expertise of computer scientists is needed: it’s inter-disciplinary and research would be served best by decades of research by sociologists, anthropologists, pyschologists, historians, etc. Can we create some benchmark datasets over which we can define methods and problems associated with bias and fairness? Can we develop theoretical guarantees around these concepts as a foundation for further research? How do we nurture interdisciplinary research across fields whose methods and language are almost equally important but almost completely divergent (e.g. mathematical proofs vs. qualitative prose)?
2.1 See <a href=""http://www.katecrawford.net/"">Kate Crawford’s</a> talk, <a href=""https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017/Schedule?showEvent=8742"">The Trouble with Bias</a> for more info. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/nipsfoundation/videos/1553500344741199/"">Video link</a></li>
  <li>There is general acknowledgement that more theory is needed to understand the state-of-the-art empirical performance across many areas of deep learning. Rahimi and Recht’s test-of-time award talk called for simple theorems and for simple, easily reproducible experiments. Why does deep learning work so well? How do these models generalize so well when, according to VC theory, they have so many parameters? Can I repeat the results of someone’s experiment from reading their paper?
3.1 See the talk by <a href=""https://keysduplicated.com/~ali/"">Ali Rahimi</a> and <a href=""http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/"">Benjamin Recht</a>, the <a href=""https://youtu.be/Qi1Yry33TQE"">test-of-time-award talk</a>, for more info.</li>
  <li>Deep reinforcement learning is all the rage. We’ve beaten humans at poker, a great entree into imperfect information games, and we’ve beaten humans at perfect-information games (Go, Shogi, and Chess) with no prior knowledge other than rules (i.e., no training data) – using the exact same set hyperparameters. We’re nowhere near DeepMind’s mission of AGI but in 2017 we’ve made some undeniably cool breakthroughs. How do we design reward functions? How do we get systems to learn new tasks more efficiently? How do we make RL systems interacting with the real world (e.g., self-driving cars) safely robust to new/rare states (avoiding an accident with a car flipping in mid-air), outliers (stop signs missing), or adversarial environments (stickers placed on signs to fool self-driving cars)?
4.1 See <a href=""https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/"">Pieter Abbeel’s</a> talk, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyOooJC_bLY"">Deep Learning for Robotics</a> for more info.</li>
  <li>GANs are hot – but we’re still not sure how they work or how to make them more usable. Ian Goodfellow suggests we can take GANs more seriously in a few years once we work some of the foundational kinks out. In essence, they’re hard to train and the learning process is somewhat unstable. Can we draw on related insights from dynamical systems theory to create more robust training objectives/regimes? How do we avoid situations where we get close to the nash equilibrium and then the parameters diverge?

</ol>

<h3 id=""practical-talks"">Practical talks</h3>

<p>There were a few talks that stood out to me for immediate application with my own work.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href=""http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7213-poincare-embeddings-for-learning-hierarchical-representations"">Poincaré Embeddings for Learning Hierarchical Representations</a>
1.1 This paper seems to implement an elegant solution that vastly outperforms earlier word2vec work and does a good job of characterizing hierarchical language relationships. Hooray for non-euclidean geometry!</li>
  <li><a href=""http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6698-self-normalizing-neural-networks"">Self-Normalizing Neural Networks</a>
2.1 This paper seems to implement a simple way to avoid manually injecting batch norm, needing to be picky about activiation functions, and achieves superior results via a new activation function and provably optimal activation function parameter settings (I wouldn’t really call alpha a hyperparameter if the setting is optimal – why would you change it).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id=""reflections-and-daily-summaries"">Reflections and daily summaries</h3>

<p>Overall, NIPS 2017 is easily one of the best conferences I’ve ever attended. It was my first NIPS and my first academic, week-long, machine-learning conference, and therefore hard to compare to other, shorter, more industry-focused conferences. It was overwhelming in terms of content. I think that next year I’ll spend weeks/months preparing by reading more of the proceedings and symposia/workshop submissions so that I can get more out of NIPS. Right now, I’m writing everything down to avoid catastrophic forgetting. Having attended NIPS, I think I’ll set my sights on other similar conferences such as ICML or ICLR.</p>

<p>At least two aspects of attending NIPS would improve with additional preparation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Poster sessions.</li>
  <li>Comprehension of talks/knowing what points are most important thereto.</li>
</ol>

<p>Because the talks are about state-of-the-art results, unless one is intimately familiar with the topic, it’s hard to know what’s important. Further, I think I could learn a lot more about being a practitioner by talking with authors of papers about their implementations and what some of their advice is for either using their methods or coding them up – what are some good hyperparameter settings? How many computational resources do I need for a reasonable implementation? What were some of your built-in assumptions about the data that weren’t explicit in your paper (e.g., perhaps known aspects of benchmark datasets that would not apply to an industrial, proprietary dataset).</p>

<p>Here’s a short overview of each day. I will link to my other posts covering my attendance of the conference. There were so many parallel tracks that I saw far fewer than half of NIPS but I will attempt to convey my experience.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monday, December 4: tutorials; invited talk; opening remarks</li>
  <li>Tuesday, December 5: invited talks; first day of talks of main NIPS proceedings</li>
  <li>Wednesday, December 6: invited talks; second day of talks of main NIPS proceedings</li>
  <li>Thursday, December 7: invited talks; final talks of main NIPS processings; symposia</li>
  <li>Friday, December 8: workshops</li>
  <li>Saturday, December 9: workshops and NIPS closing party</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=""fun-stuff"">Fun stuff</h3>

<h4 id=""deep-learning-textbook-anniversary"">Deep Learning textbook anniversary</h4>

<p>MIT Press held a one-year anniversary party for the print edition of the <a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/deep-learning"">Deep Learning</a> textbook. Ian Goodfellow, Aaron Courville, and Yoshua Bengio were all there to cut a cake on whose surface was printed the cover of the textbook – a Google deep-dream photograph from the Strawberry Fields in Central Park. Is this the first example of the output of a neural network being rendered in food? (Edit: Google handed out cookies whose recipes were learned via a neural network).</p>

<p>Someone made the inevitable joke asking how many “layers” were in the cake. It looked and tasked like a fully connected MLP of about 6-7 layers to me. Not good enough for ImageNet but good enough for an afternoon snack.</p>

<p>Lots of people got photos or took selfies with the authors, or brought their books to this event to get them signed.</p>

<p>NVidia CEO Jensen Huang was excited too and spent some time hanging out with everyone. No wonder, since the huge demand for GPUs and NVidia’s sustained success over the last few years has been fueled by the cambrian explosion of deep learning – in no small part due to the authors and even the crowd at the book signing.</p>

<h4 id=""nips-closing-party"">NIPS Closing Party</h4>

<p><a href=""http://imposteriors.wixsite.com/imposteriors"">The Imposteriors</a>, an improbably good band. The only band with 50,000 citations, amiright?</p>

<p>It was a blast to bring everyone together at the end and have the nerdiest rockstars (all rockstar scholars in their own right as well) give a great concert.</p>

<p>Toward the end they had special guest <a href=""http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/"">David Blei</a> on accordian playing polka. This led to the audience self-assembling into giant concentric markov-chains: fun was had by all.</p>

<h3 id=""corporate-presence"">Corporate presence</h3>

<p>As this was my first NIPS, I’m not much of a stakeholder in terms of what NIPS <em>should</em> be. Second, I’m an engineer and therefore already somewhat in the “enemy” camp for many of the attendees.</p>

<p>Zeitgeist: it seems like the general feeling is that the success of deep learning since 2012 has led to the corporate takeover of NIPS. Many or most attendees are not scholars but are in industry (would love exact stats on that); corporate sponsors steal a lot of attention from NIPS (both from talks and poster sessions) via expensive, flashy booths, free swag, heavy recruiting, and parties with open bars and other gimmicks.</p>

<p>This kind of attention is a double-edged sword. It’s great – look how many more people are interested in the field compared to a few years ago. It’s terrible – the hype will lead to the next AI winter, and technology is progressing too quickly to keep track of all of the potentially societally detrimental innovations such as generating realistic fake videos with geopolitical consequences or violating privacy with improved identity detection and automatic surveillance.</p>

<p>Personally, I felt 100% uninfluenced by the recruiting and generally did not attend the corporate parties. Overall, I thought it was great that all of the poster sessions were sponsored with food and drinks, encouraging folks to stick around late into the evenings.</p>

<p>Corporate party highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Intel held a Flo Rida concert and announced their latest “AI” chip, derived from their acquisition of Nervana Systems. This is exactly the plot of the pilot episode of HBO’s Silicon Valley, either a perfect self-aware example of life imitating art imitating life, or a cringe-worthy coincidence.</li>
  <li>NVidia, not to be outdone, had an orchestra play an “AI-generated” piece, unveiled a new GPU, and handed out over a dozen to the audience (MSRP ~$3k).</li>
  <li>Tesla, who did not sponsor NIPS, held an invite-only event with Elon Musk, Andrej Karpathy, and Jim Keller in an old-school mansion – they let attendees drive brand-new Model S’s to the event.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the deep-pocketed sponsors held similar events – some open, some invite-only – but those 3 are the top in terms of gimmicks that I know of.</p>

<p>Other corporate stuff:</p>

<ul>
  <li>During a lunch event, Apple announced they’d be open-sourcing turi-create, which is a fantastic move on their part. As a former user of graphlab-create, I am pleased that they are open-sourcing it and I’m looking forward to using it again.</li>
  <li>Intel had a quantum computer at their booth. It was awesome.</li>
  <li>Rennaissance Technologies had a booth with no sign on it. So badass.</li>
</ul>

Caffe: Brew your first DNN,"Wed, 29 Jul 2015 11:49:40 +0000","<h2 id=""caffe"">Caffe</h2>

<p>You can find some background for this post here: <a href=""/2015/05/04/Deep-Learning-with-Python.html"">Deep Learning with Python</a>!</p>

<p>Caffe has its strengths and its weaknesses. For example, there are some outstanding issues regarding using multiple GPUs in parallel during training. According to a wonderful write-up by <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+TomaszMalisiewicz/posts"">Tomasz Malisiewicz</a> titled <a href=""http://www.computervisionblog.com/2015/06/deep-down-rabbit-hole-cvpr-2015-and.html"">Deep down the rabbit hole: CVPR 2015 and beyond</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caffe is much more popular that Torch, but when talking to some power users of Deep Learning (like <a href=""https://plus.google.com/100209651993563042175"">+Andrej Karpathy</a> and other DeepMind scientists), a certain group of experts seems to be migrating from Caffe to Torch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read somewhere else that Caffe : Torch :: Applications : Research. If you want to quickly iterate on datasets with the aim of building applications, Caffe gives you a flexible framework with a lot of built-in tools to do so; with Python bindings to boot. Additionally, one of its great features is that you can essentially specify all of the layers and layer parameters of a neural network with a simple config file. I know that there are some out there (you know who you are! :-P) who do not like this feature.</p>

<h2 id=""prerequisites"">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Caffe has some prerequisites, which, unless you’ve already got a CUDA driver installed, will prevent you from getting started in just minutes.</p>

<p>Please go to the Caffe <a href=""http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html#prerequisites"">installation page</a> for more details. Be sure to also follow the <a href=""http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/install_osx.html"">OS X Installation</a> page very closely if you’re on a Mac like I am.</p>

<p>For going against your GPU, you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href=""http://brew.sh/"">Homebrew</a> if you don’t already have it.</li>
  <li><a href=""https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone"">CUDA</a> (if you want to use CAFFE in GPU mode, which in itself requires an NVIDIA GPU and an NVIDIA Developer login)</li>
  <li><a href=""https://developer.nvidia.com/cuDNN"">cuDNN</a> (accelerated CUDA, in a nutshell)</li>
  <li><code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">brew install boost-python</code> (simply doing <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">brew install boost</code> or <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">brew install boost --with-python</code> didn’t do the trick)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are plenty of instructions on the caffe site for getting these prerequisites installed.</p>

<p>Since we’re using Python, pay <strong>EXTRA SPECIAL ATTENTION</strong> to the Makefile.config instructions. Particularly, know where your Python and Numpy live.</p>

<p>Mine’s a little complicated since I use Homebrew for lots of things, but here’s what my config info looks like. This will save you from pulling some hair out:</p>

<p>Add these to your <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">~/.bash_profile</code> or just <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">export</code> them in your session.</p>

<p>Awesome! Finally, we can let the real fun begin.</p>

<h2 id=""model-zoo"">Model Zoo</h2>

<p>Caffe, having the great ecosystem that it does, has a special place called the <a href=""https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Model-Zoo"">“Model Zoo”</a> where various reference models and variations thereof are curated in one place with code and citations. Be sure to check it out for Caffe implementations of some of the most recent cutting-edge research, such as GoogLeNet and models from the CVPR2015 DeepVision workshop, which occurred after this blog post began.</p>

<h2 id=""deep-dreaming"">Deep Dreaming</h2>

<p>If you’re interested in some light background reading regarding GoogLeNet, the deep learning model that Google Deep Dream uses as its default, you should check out the following arXiv preprint: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842"">Going Deeper with Convolutions</a><sup id=""fnref:0"" role=""doc-noteref""><a href=""#fn:0"" class=""footnote"">1</a></sup>. Note that GoogLeNet is an homage to the pioneering work <a href=""http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/"">LeNet</a><sup id=""fnref:1"" role=""doc-noteref""><a href=""#fn:1"" class=""footnote"">2</a></sup>, built by Yann LeCun in the 80’s for handwritten digit recognition.</p>

<p>In fact, <a href=""http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/gathered/examples/mnist.html"">here</a> is a great Caffe tutorial building LeNet by hand and training it on MNIST. But I thought you’d find Google Deep Dream more interesting as a blog post :-).</p>

<p>In <a href=""http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html"">this</a> Google Research blog post, Google describes its notion of Inceptionism, and how it visualizes going deeper into neural networks. A couple of weeks later, they published <a href=""http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html"">this</a> follow-up blog post, which links you to the DeepDream <a href=""https://github.com/google/deepdream"">repo</a>, conveniently hosted on GitHub and available as an IPython Notebook <a href=""https://github.com/google/deepdream/blob/master/dream.ipynb"">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id=""deep-dreaming-prerequisites"">Deep Dreaming Prerequisites</h2>

<p>It’s simple enough to follow the IPython Notebook, but here are some instructions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure you have installed the following Python libraries: NumPy, SciPy, PIL, and IPython (just use <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">pip</code>).</li>
  <li>Make sure you have installed Caffe (i.e., that you have read the beginning of this blog post and didn’t skip ahead!).</li>
  <li>Google’s <a href=""https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/"">protobuf</a> library (I will go through this since it was a little tricky).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=""installing-protobuf"">Installing Protobuf</h2>

<p>If you’re a nerd like me, you’re insane enough to go straight to the source: Google’s protobuf GitHub repo, found <a href=""https://github.com/google/protobuf"">here</a>.</p>

<p>The installation instructions are fairly simple. Unless you are using a Mac. You can follow their instructions using MacPorts, or you can join me in 2015 and use Homebrew :-) (or the package manager of your choice).</p>

<p>Here’s the flow for a Mac user:</p>

<figure class=""highlight""><pre><code class=""language-bash"" data-lang=""bash""><span class=""nv"">$ </span>brew <span class=""nb"">install </span>autoconf
<span class=""nv"">$ </span>brew <span class=""nb"">install </span>automake
<span class=""nv"">$ </span>brew <span class=""nb"">install </span>libtool</code></pre></figure>

<p>Nice. Now you can install protobuf. Go to a directory where you’d like to put the protobuf repo.</p>

<p>Then do the following:</p>

<figure class=""highlight""><pre><code class=""language-bash"" data-lang=""bash""><span class=""nv"">$ </span>git clone https://github.com/google/protobuf.git
<span class=""nv"">$ </span><span class=""nb"">cd </span>protobuf/
<span class=""nv"">$ </span>./autogen.sh
<span class=""nv"">$ </span>./configure
<span class=""nv"">$ </span>make
<span class=""nv"">$ </span>make check
<span class=""nv"">$ </span>make <span class=""nb"">install</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Assuming that works, you’re ready to deep dream!</p>

<p>Go to a directory where you’d like to put the Deep Dream IPython notebook and <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">git clone</code> it!</p>

<figure class=""highlight""><pre><code class=""language-bash"" data-lang=""bash""><span class=""nv"">$ </span>git clone https://github.com/google/deepdream.git
<span class=""nv"">$ </span><span class=""nb"">cd </span>deepdream/
<span class=""nv"">$ </span>ipython notebook</code></pre></figure>

<p>Click on <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">dream.ipynb</code>, et voilà, you’re in.</p>

<p>Suffice to say, I won’t copy the whole notebook here. That being said, let’s take a closer look.</p>

<p>Did you run into an error when you tried to load in GoogLeNet? I did. Just because you’ve downloaded and installed Caffe doesn’t mean that you’re ready to brew!</p>

<p>Go to <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">&lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/caffe/</code>, and do the following:</p>

<figure class=""highlight""><pre><code class=""language-bash"" data-lang=""bash""><span class=""nv"">$ </span>./scripts/download_model_binary.py models/bvlc_googlenet</code></pre></figure>

<p>Once that has finished, you should be able to run the block of <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">dream.ipynb</code> that loads in a pretrained GoogLeNet. Make sure you set your <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">&lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/caffe/models/bvlc_googlenet</code> properly. Now you’re ready to deep dream.</p>

<p>Get down a few lines to where you assign:</p>

<figure class=""highlight""><pre><code class=""language-python"" data-lang=""python""><span class=""n"">img</span> <span class=""o"">=</span> <span class=""n"">np</span><span class=""p"">.</span><span class=""n"">float32</span><span class=""p"">(</span><span class=""n"">PIL</span><span class=""p"">.</span><span class=""n"">Image</span><span class=""p"">.</span><span class=""nb"">open</span><span class=""p"">(</span><span class=""s"">""your_own_image.jpg""</span><span class=""p"">))</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id=""seurat"">Seurat</h2>

<p>I’m picking my favorite work by pointillist George Seurat, his epic chef d’oeuvre, <em>Un dimanche après-midi à l’Île de la Grande Jatte</em>.</p>

<p>You don’t need to be an art history buff to appreciate this work. Perhaps you’re a fan of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091042/"">Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</a>? Who can forget the moment when Cameron sees this work from afar and becomes fixated on its perfection? Here’s a clip from their visit to the Art Institute of Chicago (click <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubpRcZNJAnE"">here</a> if you want to see the whole thing):</p>

<p>BOOM. Holy mackerel. What are all of these strange animals and pagodas and faces popping in and out of mes amis Parisiens?</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at what else we can do:</p>

<figure class=""highlight""><pre><code class=""language-python"" data-lang=""python""><span class=""n"">_</span><span class=""o"">=</span><span class=""n"">deepdream</span><span class=""p"">(</span><span class=""n"">net</span><span class=""p"">,</span>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>OK, WOW, THIS IS DEFINITELY WEIRDER.</p>

<p>The <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">octave_n</code> parameter default is 4. When you run <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">deepdream(net,img)</code> for the first time, you will see an output that ranges from <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">0 0</code> to <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">3 9</code>. The image is redrawn <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">iter_n</code> times per octave, so <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">3 9</code> here indicates (octave) 4 (interation) 10, since we’re counting from 0. Interesting. In music theory, octaves abstractly represent notes whose frequencies are double the previous octave, i.e., you have sung <em>do re me fa so la ti do</em> and both <em>do</em> notes are exactly one octave apart (and whose frequency ratio between the first and second <em>do</em> is 1:2). Here in the notebook you can follow the code to see that the definition of the octave is subject to your own experimentation!</p>

<p>Let’s do one more:</p>

<figure class=""highlight""><pre><code class=""language-python"" data-lang=""python""><span class=""n"">_</span><span class=""o"">=</span><span class=""n"">deepdream</span><span class=""p"">(</span><span class=""n"">net</span><span class=""p"">,</span> 
            <span class=""n"">img</span><span class=""p"">,</span> 
            <span class=""n"">octave_n</span><span class=""o"">=</span><span class=""mi"">13</span><span class=""p"">,</span> 
            <span class=""n"">iter_n</span><span class=""o"">=</span><span class=""mi"">13</span><span class=""p"">,</span> 
            <span class=""n"">octave_scale</span><span class=""o"">=</span><span class=""mf"">1.5</span><span class=""p"">,</span> 
            <span class=""n"">end</span><span class=""o"">=</span><span class=""s"">'inception_3a/output'</span><span class=""p"">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>What is the <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">end='inception_3a/output'</code> parameter? Check it out: submit <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">net.blobs.keys()</code> and pick a layer, any layer (except the splits, I think).</p>

<p>Here’s what we get:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

    <tr>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>How cool is that? Does it seem at all Kandinsky-esque, or is it just me?</p>

<h2 id=""what-to-do-next"">What to do next</h2>

<p>You’ve got the power of Deep Dreaming in your hands. What do you want to do? There are a couple of interesting helper functions in the notebook that I am intentionally not covering so that you can explore them yourself!</p>

<p>One loops over and over, so that the final output of calling <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">deepdream(net, img)</code> is the input – i.e., <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">img = deepdream(net, img)</code> – to another iteration of <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">deepdream(net, img)</code>. This leads to a lot of interesting compositional weirdness. Definitely what I think of as <em>inception</em>: dreams within dreams.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><img src=""/assets/inception.jpg"" alt=""We need to go deeper"" /></p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The second gives you the ability to use another image as the <em>objective guide</em> of your deep dreaming. Put another way, you can kind of think of this helper function as mashing up your deep dreaming with one image that tries to align with the other.</p>

<p>Last, if you’re feeling particularly full of free time, try building a tree of such deep dreaming. Maybe you want to train an image on a hierarchy of different images, each one dreamed from a layer below. Moreover, don’t just follow my example and deep dream with oil on canvas. Try using natural images instead. Depending on your parameters, your deep dream results could be very far out indeed.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Deep dreaming photos of people whom you love is definitely nighmare-inducing. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.</p>

Torch: bleeding edge DNN research,"Sun, 28 Jun 2015 11:49:40 +0000","<h2 id=""torch"">Torch</h2>

<p>You can find some background for this post here: <a href=""/2015/05/04/Deep-Learning-with-Python.html"">Deep Learning with Python</a>!</p>

<p>Torch has its strengths and its weaknesses. According to a wonderful write-up by <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+TomaszMalisiewicz/posts"">Tomasz Malisiewicz</a> titled <a href=""http://www.computervisionblog.com/2015/06/deep-down-rabbit-hole-cvpr-2015-and.html"">Deep down the rabbit hole: CVPR 2015 and beyond</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caffe is much more popular that Torch, but when talking to some power users of Deep Learning (like <a href=""https://plus.google.com/100209651993563042175"">+Andrej Karpathy</a> and other DeepMind scientists), a certain group of experts seems to be migrating from Caffe to Torch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read somewhere else that Caffe : Torch :: Applications : Research. If you want to do serious research in deep learning, I would suggest using Torch given the level of current interest in the ecosystem, as well as Torch’s flexibility and platform. Facebook AI and Google DeepMind use Torch.</p>

<p>The adept reader may be thinking, “wait a second… I thought this was a series of blog posts about doing deep learning with Python… but Torch is all Lua”, and yes, you are right, Torch is not a Python tool (though some parts of Torch have Python bindings): Torch, from a user’s perspective, is mostly Lua.</p>

<p>For someone well-acquainted with Python, Lua isn’t so different. If doing deep learning is more important to you than what language you use, use Torch. If using Python is more important than using all of the potential horsepower available to you at your fingertips, then don’t use Torch, but just know that – as of this blog post – it’s increasingly the research tool of choice.</p>

<h2 id=""prerequisites"">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>The documentation for Torch is great. They make installation as easy as a few lines of bash! Here’s a link to <a href=""http://torch.ch"">Torch</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s get started. Assuming you don’t mind installing torch into <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">~/torch</code>, you can just use the following bash commands to get started.</p>

<div class=""language-bash highlighter-rouge""><div class=""highlight""><pre class=""highlight""><code><span class=""nv"">$ </span>curl <span class=""nt"">-sk</span> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torch/ezinstall/master/install-deps | bash
<span class=""nv"">$ </span>git clone https://github.com/torch/distro.git ~/torch <span class=""nt"">--recursive</span>
<span class=""nv"">$ </span><span class=""nb"">cd</span> ~/torch<span class=""p"">;</span> ./install.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now Torch, LuaJIT, LuaRocks (package manager akin to <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">pip</code>), and some packages (installed via LuaRocks) are installed. Type <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">th</code> to use the REPL, and in the REPL, you can type <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">os.exit()</code> to quit.</p>

<p>At the end you’ll be prompted to add Torch to your PATH environment variable. Type ‘yes’ to complete everything. Just do a quick <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">source ~/.bashrc</code> to update your environment.</p>

<p>Head to Torch’s <a href=""http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html"">getting started</a> page for more.</p>

<p>Now we’re ready to begin. Fasten your seltbelt: some crazy s*** is about to go down.</p>

<h2 id=""extending-torch-to-generate-joycean-prose"">Extending Torch to generate Joycean prose</h2>

<p>What the… what does that even mean?</p>

<p>I’ll show you.</p>

<p>Andrej Karpathy’s very detailed and extremely interesting blog post, <em><a href=""http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/"">The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks</a></em>, goes through several examples that harness code that he very kindly open-sourced <a href=""https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn"">here</a>, to implement a “multi-layer Recurrent Neural Network (RNN, LSTM, and GRU) for training/sampling from character-level language models.”</p>

<p>To do that, <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">git clone</code> the repo wherever you like. Then:</p>

<div class=""language-bash highlighter-rouge""><div class=""highlight""><pre class=""highlight""><code><span class=""nv"">$ </span>luarocks <span class=""nb"">install </span>nngraph 
<span class=""nv"">$ </span>luarocks <span class=""nb"">install </span>optim
<span class=""nv"">$ </span>luarocks <span class=""nb"">install </span>cutorch <span class=""c""># for GPU use</span>
<span class=""nv"">$ </span>luarocks <span class=""nb"">install </span>cunn    <span class=""c""># for GPU use</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>OK. Awesome. Now that we’ve got that out of the way, let’s get some data:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><img src=""/assets/big_data.png"" alt=""Big Data"" /></p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Lulz. Let’s skip the big data for now and just start with something small: the full text of my favorite novel, James Joyce’s 1922 masterpiece, Ulysses. Full text available <a href=""https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4300"">here</a> via one of the files types of your choosing (I chose .txt for this project). In a text editor, I removed the beginning/end of the file what I considered to be unreflective of Joyce, namely, the Project Gutenberg boilerplate :-). My file begins, famously:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>– I –</p>

  <p>Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And ends, famously:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>yes I said yes I will Yes.</p>

  <p>Trieste-Zurich-Paris 1914-1921</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sweet. Now navigate to your <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">char-rnn</code> directory, and move your Ulysses text file to <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">&lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/char-rnn/data/ulysses/input.txt</code> (obviously doing <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">mkdir &lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/char-rnn/data/ulysses</code> first).</p>

<p>If you want to look at some settings, you can type <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">th train.lua -help</code>, otherwise, let’s start training on Ulysses.</p>

<div class=""language-bash highlighter-rouge""><div class=""highlight""><pre class=""highlight""><code><span class=""nv"">$ </span>th train.lua <span class=""nt"">-data_dir</span> data/ulysses <span class=""nt"">-gpuid</span> <span class=""nt"">-1</span> <span class=""c""># this goes against your CPU</span>
<span class=""nv"">$ </span>th train.lua <span class=""nt"">-data_dir</span> data/ulysses 		<span class=""c""># this goes against your GPU</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If sucessful, you should see some output like this:</p>

<div class=""language-bash highlighter-rouge""><div class=""highlight""><pre class=""highlight""><code>1897/28850 <span class=""o"">(</span>epoch 3.288<span class=""o"">)</span>, train_loss <span class=""o"">=</span> 1.76713313, grad/param norm <span class=""o"">=</span> 9.8094e-02, <span class=""nb"">time</span>/batch <span class=""o"">=</span> 0.21s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s sample from a training checkpoint and see what kind of text we generate.</p>

<div class=""language-bash highlighter-rouge""><div class=""highlight""><pre class=""highlight""><code><span class=""c"">## When sampling, be consistent w.r.t. whether or not you trained/are training with your CPU or GPU.</span>

<p>Wow, that’s stunning. “Brillig” makes me think of Jabberwocky, and there are some humorous gems in there. Notice how real sentence structures are starting to take shape and notice the references to multiple characters, including their nicknames. And the various portmonteaus and <em>jeu de mots</em>. Remember that this model trains at the character level and at the start of training didn’t know a thing about English or anything else relating to the structure of language or prose. Fascinating.</p>

<p>How did we get this?</p>

<p>One of the command-line arguments used for sampling is called <em>temperature</em>, whose flag is <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">-t</code>. This can be a float between 0 and 1 (must be strictly &gt; 0). To give some intuition, temperature is in a sense the amount of creative license you are giving to your trained RNN while sampling from it. A temperature of 1 allows for the most creative license. This will give perhaps the most interesting results, but said results may not resemble (depending on the size of your network, the size of your data, and how it fits) something that is as readable as something sampled at a lower temperature. Conversely, lower temperature samples are more conservative: sampling at lower temperatures is more likely to result in samples that behave very nicely, yet they can even be <em>boring</em>. In some cases extremely low temperatures will cause self-repeating loops. Here is a very sad example where I have set the temperature = 0.1 (sad because Ulysses is so characteristically original and unrepetitive).</p>

<p>Indeed this isn’t quite as fun. Notice how conservative our RNN has become w.r.t. sampling new words and structures. It’s not perfectly repetitive, but it sure reads like it. Remember, this is being sampled character-by-character.</p>

<h2 id=""what-to-do-next"">What to do next</h2>

<p>You may be inspired to mashup your favorite authors. You may be inspired to train an RNN on Finnegans Wake.<sup id=""fnref:2"" role=""doc-noteref""><a href=""#fn:2"" class=""footnote"">2</a></sup> <em>Klikkaklakkaklaskaklopatzklatschabattacreppycrottygraddaghsemmihsammihnouithappluddyappladdypkonpkot</em>. You may be inspired to mashup texts in more than one language. You may be inspired to train an RNN on code, or perhaps sheet music. Perhaps you may be inspired to train one on audio or video files.<sup id=""fnref:1"" role=""doc-noteref""><a href=""#fn:1"" class=""footnote"">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Try training on a larger corpus. Try increasing the size of your network layers, as well as the number of layers. To paraphrase <a href=""http://www.andrewng.org/"">Andrew Ng</a>, if your training error is too high, then add more rocket fuel (data), and if your test error is high, then add more rockets (i.e., increase the size of your deep neural network).</p>

<p>In this post, we have only explored a single deep learning model: a recurrent neural network with a long short term memory. Torch is extremely flexible and can be used for (as far as I know) neural networks topologies represented by arbitrary directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) – though bi-directional RNNs and other valid DNN architectures seem to violate the DAG requirement – I need to learn more. If you’re a graph theory nerd like I am, that is pretty cool. In fact, that should be its own blog post.</p>

<p>Another thing you can do is do a deep dive into the literature! Here is an excellent technical <a href=""http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/preprint.pdf"">primer</a><sup id=""fnref:3"" role=""doc-noteref""><a href=""#fn:3"" class=""footnote"">4</a></sup>.</p>

      <p>To be fair, Finnegans Wake is more readable than this, but when I think of Finnegans Wake in the back of my mind, it is almost no different than this first example. Let’s see how successive Epochs bring our RNN closer to Ulysses. Next I’ll train an RNN on Finnegans Wake itself. Yikes! <a href=""#fnref:0"" class=""reversefootnote"" role=""doc-backlink"">&#8617;</a></p>

An Antique Neural Network for Image Classification,"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 04:09:00 +0000","Quite accidentally I found the picture below showing my research work in 1994 when I trained a neural network to identify the land use types from a satellite image. The neural network had a structure of 3 input neurons, corresponding to the blue, green, and red bands of a Landsat TM image, 14 hidden neurons, and 7 output neurons, representing seven land use types including the cornfields, wheat fields, water bodies, impervious surfaces, etc. The number of training data points is 65. <br><br>   I coded everything from scratch including the algorithm and the user interface using C++. There were no prebuilt packages to use, no internet to search the information, and no such thing as asking questions on social media.  The computer used had a 486 CPU, a 32-megabyte memory, and a hard drive with less than 500-megabyte storage.  <br><br>   How things have changed in 27 years! With a deep learning neural network, such as a convolutional neural network, many layers of neurons serving different purposes can be stacked together to form a complex structure and collectively perform recognitive tasks that were unthinkable in the past. And all these can be done with a few lines of Python scripts and the execution is often done in a cloud computing environment with virtually unlimited computation and storage resources.

Taking Operational Efficiency to the Next Level: Leverage the 95-5 Rule of Automation,"Sat, 18 Sep 2021 10:27:00 +0000","<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TafX-flFmrY/YUW9kT_bzqI/AAAAAAAAq74/akpSzY_CFlYGiXqKseZQ04CSLQIY_ISpgCLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/rule-9505.jpeg"" style=""display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; ""><img alt="""" border=""0"" width=""400"" data-original-height=""1365"" data-original-width=""2048"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TafX-flFmrY/YUW9kT_bzqI/AAAAAAAAq74/akpSzY_CFlYGiXqKseZQ04CSLQIY_ISpgCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/rule-9505.jpeg""/></a></div>Through an odyssey of over two decades helping clients in various industries solve hard problems, I have gained a deep appreciation of a pattern that can be leveraged to dramatically improve the quality and efficiency of the work and, ultimately, the return on investment of businesses.<br><br> Whether it is inventory planning, or financial fraudulent transaction detection, or finding costly insurance claims, it generally holds true that 95% of the work can be resolved by automated algorithms. The remaining 5% needs to be done by domain experts using their expertise, intuition, and creativity. I call it the 95-5 rule of automation.<br><br> The 95-5 rule is not simply a division of the labor between machines and human experts flatly in that proportion. There is a structural and temporal implication in it. Algorithms are first applied to a raw problem, which involves a large number of cases and big data and is hard or inefficient to solve manually. This step produces as an output a simpler problem where the work is greatly reduced, by 95% generally. Human experts then work on this reduced problem and make their judgment calls to reach the final decision.<br><br>  <div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BGmLrwI_HRs/YUW9OutzizI/AAAAAAAAq7w/4M1VVkP_RSoGmlUTcw738j53KbFYM9AAQCLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/rule-do-2.png"" style=""display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; ""><img alt="""" border=""0"" width=""400"" data-original-height=""1066"" data-original-width=""2048"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BGmLrwI_HRs/YUW9OutzizI/AAAAAAAAq7w/4M1VVkP_RSoGmlUTcw738j53KbFYM9AAQCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/rule-do-2.png""/></a></div> Take as an example our solution to a worker compensation insurance claim problem. A company receives about 200 worker injury claims daily. Our algorithm highlights 10 (5% of the total) of them as potentially costly using a machine learning model based on factors including age, cause of injury, and injury body parts. Using these 10 cases as a starting point, analysts review them carefully and take proper action. The solution has resulted in a 40% reduction in claim loss.<br><br> To recap, in the real world the 95-5 rule of automation works this way: applying algorithms to a raw problem to reduce the work by 95% and subsequently having human experts take on the reduced problem.<br><br> Here are the benefits as reported by our clients that have adopted solutions based on the 95-5 rule of automation.<br><br> <ul><li>Improved outcomes. For example, a bank sees its fraud loss reduced by 70%. Another bank finds the bad debt rate dropping by 50%. <li>Increased efficiency. In a K12 education company, content tagging is 100 times more efficient than a manual process. <li>More jobs. A group in a bank hires more analysts because the operation there drives a good return on investment. <li>Improved employees' morale. This is because they work on the reduced problem where the same amount of effort generates more fruitful outcomes. ( I did not realize this point until I saw a report produced by an independent department from a client company.) </ul>  <br>When the rule is applied to inventory planning, our advanced optimization algorithm generates a set of recommended safety stocks for all items which serves as the foundation for planners to make further improvements. <br><br> One lesson that we have learned is that, unless it is an exceptionally simple circumstance, domain experts should not work with the raw problem directly. Unfortunately, the violation of this principle is happening every day resulting in ineffective, inefficient, and unscalable operations and a stressful workforce. The whole situation is avoidable.<br><br><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0yt2vFrGwl0/YUW-w54gFOI/AAAAAAAAq8A/GoTU_pKt7p4bix3i5WKAKWMprprF2jeEACLcBGAsYHQ/s1847/Rule-not-do.png"" style=""display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; ""><img alt="""" border=""0"" width=""400"" data-original-height=""1050"" data-original-width=""1847"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0yt2vFrGwl0/YUW-w54gFOI/AAAAAAAAq8A/GoTU_pKt7p4bix3i5WKAKWMprprF2jeEACLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Rule-not-do.png""/></a></div> The 95-5 rule of automation has worked for us remarkably.

Some managers adopt ABC analysis to divide stock items into several groups based on their values and assign the DS to each group. When we set DS to 91% for all items as shown in Figure 1, the average DS is 91% and the total value of safety stock is $129,985. <br><br>    However, we can do much better. By setting the DS for each item more intelligently, we can keep the average DS of 91% and reduce the total safety stock by about 16% (Figure 2). Or by assigning a different set of DSs, we can maintain the same total safety stock budget and increase the average DS from 91% to 93% (Figure 3). <br><br>    <h3>Figure 2.

On the other hand, safety stock that is too high incurs significant financial and/or logistics burden to the business.<br/><br/>   The calculation of safety stock is based on a number of factors include historical customer demands, product lead time and fill rate (a.k.a., demand satisfaction).

Querying Database Using Command Line Client and Powershell,"Tue, 03 Mar 2020 04:12:00 +0000","<html><style type=""text/css"">pre{border: 2px solid #666; padding: 10px; background-color: lightgray;} pre.code {border: 2px solid #666; padding: 10px; background-color: lightyellow;} pre.out {border: 2px solid #666; padding: 10px; background-color: lightgray;} div.code {color:blue} </style>I have found Powershell is a powerful tool. When it combines with a command line tool, such as mysql, we can perform sophisticated tasks easily. The output of Powershell is an object instead of a text string. We can perform SQL-like operations such as selecting columns and filtering rows using where clause. Since I found out the power of Powershell last year, I have been using Powershell as my major tool to query databases including SQL Server, MySQl and Postgre. In this post, I demonstrate how to query MySQL using mysql client and Powershell.</br></br> First, we run the following command to set up our host, user name, password and port.  <pre><br />mysql_config_editor set --login-path=local --host=localhost <br />                         --user=root --port=3306 --password<br /></pre>When we run the above command at a shell, it will prompt us to input password. It will create a file .mylogin.cnf that is not humanly readable under home directory (I am using Mac. For Windows, the file is under %APPDATA%\MySQL). The reason of doing this is to avoid an annoying security warning message if we supply the password in mysql command. If you don't mind the warning message, you can skip the step.  Then I write a Powershell function to query MySQL database. I save the scripts as mysql_f.ps1 on my Mac. <pre><br />function runsql {<br />param($s)<br />mysql --login-path=local -D dataexp -B -e ""$s"" | convertfrom-csv -delimiter `t<br />}<br /></pre>  I issue the following command from the shell <pre><br />prompt>. ""./mysql_f.ps1""<br /></pre> Now the function is defined. I test the function. <pre><br />prompt>runsql ""select 1 as val""<br /><br />val<br />---<br />1<br /></pre>It worked. The following query displays the table in the current database. <pre><br />prompt>runsql ""select TABLE_SCHEMA, table_name, create_time <br />       from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()""<br /><br />TABLE_SCHEMA TABLE_NAME             CREATE_TIME<br />------------ ----------             -----------<br />dataexp      flyway_schema_history  2019-11-21 11:56:31<br />dataexp      mdl_sampled            2020-01-14 10:40:06<br />dataexp      mdl_set                2020-01-14 09:46:59<br />dataexp      sample_user_id         2020-01-14 09:58:34<br />dataexp      t_all_pk1              2019-12-05 11:53:43<br />dataexp      t_all_pk1_int          2019-12-05 22:14:54<br />dataexp      t_all_tab_cols         2019-11-21 15:39:00<br /></pre> From the Powershell output, we select only table_name an create_time by piping the output to ""select"" command of Powershell. <pre><br />prompt>runsql ""select TABLE_SCHEMA, table_name, create_time <br />       from information_schema.tables <br />  where table_schema=database()"" | select table_name, create_time<br />TABLE_NAME             CREATE_TIME<br />----------             -----------<br />flyway_schema_history  2019-11-21 11:56:31<br />mdl_sampled            2020-01-14 10:40:06<br />mdl_set                2020-01-14 09:46:59<br />sample_user_id         2020-01-14 09:58:34<br />t_all_pk1              2019-12-05 11:53:43<br />t_all_pk1_int          2019-12-05 22:14:54<br />t_all_tab_cols         2019-11-21 15:39:00<br /></pre> The above operation is possible because in runsql function, we use convertfrom-csv to convert text output of mysql to Powershell object. Convertfrom-csv is really a magic function! Once we have an Powershell object, we can do all sorts of things.   </html>",https://www.deep-data-mining.com/2020/03/querying-database-using-command-line.html
Optimizing Inventory Level: Reduce the Inventory Value and Increase Customer Satisfaction Simultaneously,"Sun, 27 Oct 2019 15:44:00 +0000"," <html><head><meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html; charset=us-ascii""> <title></title></head><body><p>For a large part manufacture company in the transportation industry, maintaining the optimal inventory level in their warehouses is crucial to its bottom line. When too many parts are produced and stored, it costs the company excessive financial investment and previous warehouse spaces. On the other hand, if not enough parts in the warehouses, customers will become dissatisfied when orders may not get fulfilled in time. Thus, there are two conflicting goals to balance when planning the inventory: reducing inventory value and increasing customer satisfaction. The optimal strategy is to find the sweet spot of inventory level for each individual part that is most economical and maintaining high level of customer satisfaction at the same time.  In a recent project that Dr. Jay Zhou has preformed, he is able to reduce the inventory level for his client company by $16 million and still maintain the same level of customer satisfaction. This work is highly received by the client.</br></br> In this project, Dr.Zhou takes advantage of machine learning models and reduces huge number of parts to a much smaller number of homogeneous groups. The ""Demand Satisfaction"" are calculated for these groups.    </p>",https://www.deep-data-mining.com/2019/10/optimizing-inventory-level-reduce.html

Of course, there are use cases that are best solved with artificial neural networks: image, speech and text recognition; anomaly detection and predictive maintenance on sensor data; complex data synthesis and sampling; reinforcement and sparse learning; and many more applications show the potential of artificial intelligence for real-world business scenarios. At the Deep Learning World conference data science experts present projects that went beyond experimentation and prototyping and showcase solutions that created economic value for the company. The case study sessions will focus on how it worked and what didn’t work while the deep dive sessions will explain topics such as RNN, CNN, LSTM, transfer learning and further in analytical and technical detail.

Many companies invested in their infrastructure and are experimenting with prototypes e.g. for predictive maintenance, dynamic replenishment, route optimization and more, but even if they succeeded in delivering a proof of concept they face the challenge to deploy their predictive model into production and scale their analytics solution to company wide adoption. The issues are not merely analytical but a combination of technical, organisational, judicial and economic details. At the Predictive Analytics World for Industry 4.0 experienced data scientists and business decision makers from a wide variety of industries will meet for two days to demonstrate and to discuss dozens of real-world case studies from well-known industry leaders. In addition, predictive analytics experts will explore new methods and tools in special deep dive sessions in detail. Finally, the Predictive Analytics World is accompanied by the Deep Learning World conference, which focuses on the industry and business application of neural networks.
